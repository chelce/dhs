# Quick Start Guide: Lesson Reflection System

## After Each Significant Lesson
1. Copy the template from `templates/lesson-reflection-template.md`
2. Save it in the appropriate month folder with format: `YYYY-MM-DD-lesson-topic.md`
3. Fill out the key sections (even if brief)
4. Rate the lesson 1-5 stars for quick reference

## For Interactive Activities
1. Use `templates/activity-assessment-template.md`
2. Focus on what worked and what didn't
3. Note specific student feedback
4. Track technology successes/failures

## Monthly Reviews
1. Use `templates/monthly-summary-template.md`
2. Look for patterns across lessons
3. Plan improvements for the following month
4. Note resource needs

## Quick Tips
- **Don't aim for perfect documentation** - brief notes are better than none
- **Focus on actionable insights** - what would help you next time?
- **Use tags** to make lessons searchable later
- **Include student quotes** when they give feedback
- **Note the context** - class dynamics, time of year, external factors
