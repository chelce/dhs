# Opening Activity Planning for Next Year

**Based on**: August 23, 2025 lesson experience
**Key Insight**: Students need "friendly thinking" activities, not overcomplicated puzzles

## DEFINITE KEEPERS for Next Year üåü

### Scattergories - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê GOLD STAR ACTIVITY
- **Why it worked**: Familiar format, inclusive, right challenge level
- **Student response**: "Can we play again?" - universal excitement
- **Use for**: Opening activities, vocabulary review, brain breaks, community building
- **Prep needed**: Categories list, timer, simple materials

### Baker's Problem - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Maybe keep, maybe replace)
- **Why it was okay**: Some engagement, better than logic puzzles
- **Why it wasn't great**: Still confusing for many students, too abstract
- **Decision needed**: Find simpler problem-solving activities or save for later in year
- **Alternative approach**: Look for more concrete, visual problem-solving options

## AVOID Next Year ‚ùå

### Logic Puzzles - Complete Failure
- **Why it failed**: Too abstract, grid concept too complex for age group
- **Student response**: Frustration, confusion, many giving up
- **Time wasted**: 40 minutes of struggling
- **Lesson learned**: Don't assume prior experience with complex formats

## SEARCH FOR: "Friendly Thinking" Activities üéØ

**Criteria for new activities**:
- Challenges thinking but feels approachable
- NOT overcomplicated or intimidating  
- Familiar formats that students can grasp quickly
- Inclusive - everyone can participate at their level
- Engaging but not frustratingly difficult

**Ideas to explore**:
- Pattern games (visual patterns, number patterns)
- Word puzzles (crosswords, word searches with thinking elements)
- Creative problem-solving scenarios
- "Would you rather" with reasoning
- Simple strategy games
- Story/scenario-based thinking challenges
- Brain teasers with accessible entry points

## Lesson Structure That Worked

1. **High-energy starter** (Scattergories) - gets everyone engaged
2. **Sustained thinking activity** (Baker's Problem) - deeper engagement
3. **Have backup ready** - crucial when main activity fails

## Key Teaching Insights

- **Pivot faster**: Don't spend 40 minutes on something that isn't working
- **Student comfort zone**: Start with familiar, build to challenging
- **Preparation matters**: Answer keys and materials ready in advance
- **Observe engagement**: Universal participation = right activity level

## Action Items for Summer Planning
- [ ] Create comprehensive Scattergories category bank
- [ ] Research simpler problem-solving activities to replace Baker's Problem
- [ ] Find "friendly thinking" activities that aren't abstract or confusing
- [ ] Test new activities to ensure they're truly accessible, not just "okay"
- [ ] Build collection of backup activities for when plans change
- [ ] Look for concrete, visual problem-solving options instead of abstract word problems
