# Activity Assessment: Baker's Problem

**Date**: 2025-08-23  
**Activity Name**: Baker's Problem  
**Subject Area**: Problem-solving / Mathematical thinking  
**Activity Type**: Individual/small group problem solving

## Activity Details
**Duration**: Part of opening activity session
**Materials Needed**: 
- Problem statement
- Paper for student work
- ⚠️ **NEEDED**: Answer key (create for next time!)

**Setup Time**: Quick - just distribute problem
**Complexity Level**: Medium - appropriate challenge level

## Student Response
**Engagement Level**: Medium - okay engagement but some confusion
**Participation Rate**: Mixed - some students worked through it, others struggled with concept
**Skill Level Required**: Still too complex/confusing for many students at this level

## Implementation Notes
**What Worked Smoothly**:
- Some students engaged with the problem-solving process
- Better than logic puzzles but still not ideal
- Students attempted the problem

**Challenges Faced**:
- **Major issue**: No answer key prepared - couldn't provide immediate feedback
- **Problem complexity**: Still confusing for many students at this level
- Students struggled with the problem concept itself
- Need simpler, more accessible problem-solving activities

## Future Modifications
**Immediate Improvements**:
- [x] **FIND SIMPLER PROBLEMS** - this level still too complex/confusing
- [ ] Look for more concrete, visual problem-solving activities
- [ ] Consider stepping stones to build up to this type of thinking

**Resource Needs**:
- [ ] Find age-appropriate problem-solving activities
- [ ] More concrete, less abstract problem types
- [ ] Visual or hands-on problem-solving options

## Recommendation
**Overall Rating**: ⭐⭐⭐ (okay but still too confusing for many)
**Recommend for Future Use**: Maybe - need to find simpler alternatives first
**Best Used For**: Might work for advanced students or later in year after building foundation
**Optimal Timing**: Not ideal for opening activities - too complex for first impression

## For Next Year
**Keep This**: Problem-solving concept is good
**Improve This**: Find much simpler, more concrete problem-solving activities
**Timing**: This type of abstract problem may work later in year, not as opener

## Action Items
- [ ] **Priority**: Create complete answer key for Baker's Problem
- [ ] Develop step-by-step solution guide
- [ ] Consider creating similar problems for variety
