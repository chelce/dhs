# Tomorrow's Lesson Plan: Scattergories + Analogies

**Date**: August 28, 2025  
**Structure**: Scattergories (15 min) + Group Analogies (35-40 min) + Wrap-up (5 min)

## Analogies Activity Structure

### Format: Multiple Choice Group Analogies
- Groups of 3-4 students
- Each analogy shows: **A : B :: C : ?**
- Four answer choices, each showing different **C : D** pairings
- Groups must discuss and agree on the best analogy match

### Time Breakdown:
- **Round 1**: Easier analogies (15 minutes) - 8-10 analogies
- **Round 2**: Medium analogies (15 minutes) - 6-8 analogies  
- **Round 3**: Challenge analogies (10 minutes) - 4-5 analogies
- **Discussion**: Groups share their reasoning (5 minutes)

## Sample Analogies for Tomorrow

### Round 1: Easier Analogies (Clear relationships)

**1. CAT : MEOW :: DOG : ?**
a) Dog : Woof
b) Dog : Tail  
c) Dog : Pet
d) Dog : Run

**2. HOT : COLD :: UP : ?**
a) Up : High
b) Up : Down
c) Up : Sky
d) Up : Climb

**3. BOOK : READ :: SONG : ?**
a) Song : Music
b) Song : Listen
c) Song : Singer
d) Song : Loud

**4. HAND : GLOVE :: FOOT : ?**
a) Foot : Walk
b) Foot : Shoe
c) Foot : Toe
d) Foot : Ground

### Round 2: Medium Analogies (Require more thinking)

**5. TEACHER : CLASSROOM :: CHEF : ?**
a) Chef : Food
b) Chef : Kitchen
c) Chef : Cook
d) Chef : Restaurant

**6. PENCIL : WRITE :: SCISSORS : ?**
a) Scissors : Paper
b) Scissors : Cut
c) Scissors : Sharp
d) Scissors : Tool

**7. LIBRARY : BOOKS :: MUSEUM : ?**
a) Museum : Building
b) Museum : Art
c) Museum : Visit
d) Museum : Old

### Round 3: Challenge Analogies (Abstract relationships)

**8. SMILE : HAPPINESS :: FROWN : ?**
a) Frown : Face
b) Frown : Sadness
c) Frown : Expression
d) Frown : Mouth

**9. KEY : UNLOCK :: QUESTION : ?**
a) Question : Ask
b) Question : Answer
c) Question : Problem
d) Question : Think

## Group Work Instructions

### For Students:
1. **Read the analogy together** - make sure everyone understands the first pair
2. **Discuss the relationship** - how are the first two words connected?
3. **Look at all four choices** - which one has the same relationship?
4. **Agree as a group** - everyone must be able to explain the choice
5. **Be ready to share your reasoning** - why did you pick that answer?

### Teacher Circulation Notes:
- Listen for groups explaining relationships correctly
- Ask "How are these two words connected?" if groups are stuck
- Encourage groups to explain their thinking to each other
- Note which analogies cause the most discussion (good for whole-class sharing)

## Materials Needed:
- [ ] Analogy worksheets for each group
- [ ] Answer key for quick checking
- [ ] Timer for each round
- [ ] Whiteboard to track group progress (optional)

## Extension Ideas:
- If groups finish early: Have them create their own analogy for other groups
- Struggling groups: Focus on identifying the relationship in the first pair before looking at choices
- Advanced groups: Challenge them to explain why the other choices don't work

**Success Metric**: Groups actively discussing and deliberating, not just one person deciding
