# Lesson Reflection - August 29, 2025

## Class Summaries

### 2A (Blue)
**Activities**: 
- ABC game: Kitchen items + Things smaller than a golf ball
- Brief analogies introduction (5 minutes to start)
- Hearts & dollars system introduced

**How it went**: Good pacing, completed both ABC categories successfully

**Next time**: Continue analogies work

---

### AP (Orange) 
**Activities**:
- Rhetorical situation notes (triangle - 004 slides)
- SPACE[cat], in/out group, demographics/psychographics, persona
- Self-profiling exercise
- Found ads targeting them, discussed targeting attributes
- Group work creating profiles of others
- Assigned first vocab list

**How it went**: Students work more efficiently than expected, felt scrambling to keep up. Depth uncertain.

**Next time**: Students take 2 classmates' profiles, explain how to target each for same product. Groups vote on best targeting.

**Upcoming**: Vocab #1 + Intellectual Devotional Week 9 quiz tentatively Week 3

---

### 4B (Hot Pink)
**Activities**:
- ABC game (kitchen items only) - took unexpectedly long
- Analogies - got through many, but 1/3 of class will need more content
- Hearts & dollars system introduced and payments made

**How it went**: ABC game timing issue, analogies successful for most

**Next time**: Need more analogies or additional activity for faster finishers

## Key Observations

**What Worked Well**:
- Kids liked analogies and seemed to understand them
- Analogies worth bringing back and adding to mix-n-match pool
- Hearts & dollars system launch successful

**Issues to Address**:
- Group adherence problem - students not staying in assigned groups
- Consider heart penalty for group assignment violations
- 4B ABC game pacing unexpectedly slow

**Action Items**:
- Create AP vocab list for next week âœ“ (assigned today)
- Prepare more analogies content for 4B
- Plan group targeting exercise for AP
- Consider group adherence enforcement strategy

**Payment Status**: B day students all paid up

## Notes for Future
- NFC key integration postponed but hearts/dollars system operational
- AP students may need faster-paced planning to match their efficiency
- Analogies activity confirmed as keeper for future use
