# Lesson Reflection: August 28, 2025 - Analogies Activity

**Classes**: 3a, 2a  
**Activities**: Scattergories + Group Analogies  
**Overall Success**: Strong - both activities worked well

## What Worked Well
- **Analogies difficulty level**: "The right kind of tricky"
- **Activity engagement**: Both classes engaged well with the format
- **2a focus**: Stayed focused and understood the analogy process
- **Activity duration**: Good pacing overall

## Areas for Improvement
- **Easy analogies**: Too many close answer choices - reduce for clarity
- **Answer format**: Have students write whole analogy, not just answer choice (much faster checking)
- **Physical materials**: Physical cards would work better than digital for group work

## Class-Specific Notes
- **3a**: Off-task talking during work time, group of 4 boys already separated, hearts system needed for tangible redirect tracking
- **2a**: Focused well, good understanding of analogy mechanics

## Timing Adjustments Noted
- **Scattergories**: 20-30 minutes per round, can do 2 rounds comfortably
- **Analogies**: About 30 minutes for full activity

## Future Opportunities
- Literary analogies to explore parallelism
- Categories game (Jamaica version) with shared starting letters
- ABC game from SIOP training

## Immediate Next Steps
- Create analogies skill check/quiz (promised to students)
- Implement hearts system for 3a (focus management)
- Modify analogy materials based on today's observations
