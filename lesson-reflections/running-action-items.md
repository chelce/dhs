# Running Action Items & Future Plans

**Last Updated**: August 28, 2025

## Upcoming Tasks to Remember

### Assessment Plans
- [ ] **Analogies skill check/quiz** - promised to students after today's lesson

### Classroom Management
- [ ] **Debut hearts system** - 3a needs this sooner rather than later (off-task talking, group of 4 boys already separated, need tangible redirect tracking)

### Activity Modifications
- [ ] **Create physical analogy cards** - would be better than digital for group work
- [ ] **Modify easy analogies** - reduce number of very close answer choices
- [ ] **Update analogy worksheets** - have students write whole analogy, not just answer choice

### New Activity Ideas to Explore
- [ ] **Literary analogies** - explore parallelism through analogy structure
- [ ] **Categories game (Jamaica version)** - categories with same starting letter, 1 point for unique answers, split points for duplicates (easy categories: animal, food, etc.)
- [ ] **ABC game from SIOP training** - follow up on this connection

### Timing Notes for Future Planning
- **Scattergories**: 20-30 minutes per round, can happily do 2 rounds
- **Analogies activity**: About 30 minutes for full activity
