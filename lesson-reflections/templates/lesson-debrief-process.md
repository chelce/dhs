# Universal Lesson Debrief Process

## Step 1: Teacher Overview
**Teacher provides brief summary of:**
- What activities were done
- General sense of how things went
- Any immediate observations

## Step 2: AI-Generated Focus Questions
**Based on the teacher's overview, AI asks targeted questions about:**
- Specific challenges or successes mentioned
- Timing and pacing issues
- Student engagement patterns
- Material effectiveness
- Classroom management observations

## Step 3: Actionable Next Steps
**Together we identify:**
- What to keep the same
- What to modify for next time
- New ideas that emerged
- Items to add to running task list

## Step 4: Documentation
**Record in appropriate files:**
- Key insights in reflection file
- Modifications for future planning
- Add action items to running list
- Update lesson materials if needed

*This process should take 5-10 minutes and focus on practical, actionable insights rather than theoretical analysis.*
