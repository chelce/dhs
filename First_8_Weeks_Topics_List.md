## WEEK 1

**Monday (History): The Alphabet**

**Friday (Music): The Basics**
- Fundamental concepts of music theory including pitch (frequency of sound waves), scales (stepwise arrangements of pitches), and keys (tonal centers). Western music uses twelve unique pitches and primarily major and minor scales to create musical structure.

**Saturday (Philosophy): Appearance and Reality**

**Friday (Music): Harmony**
- The sounding of multiple pitches simultaneously that gives music color and depth. Built on intervals and chords (especially triads), harmony creates the distinction between consonance (stable, pleasing sounds) and dissonance (unstable, tense sounds) that drives musical progression.

**Saturday (Philosophy): Plato**
