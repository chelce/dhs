## Technical Implementation Details

### Dynamic Sizing System
```javascript
function adjustCardHeight(cardInner) {
    const isFlipped = cardInner.classList.contains('flipped');
    const frontCard = cardInner.querySelector('.card-front');
    const backCard = cardInner.querySelector('.card-back');
    
    // Measure the height of the visible face
    const visibleCard = isFlipped ? backCard : frontCard;
    const cardHeight = visibleCard.scrollHeight;
    
    // Smoothly animate to the new height
    cardInner.style.height = cardHeight + 'px';
}
```

### CSS Grid Responsive Architecture
```css
.card-container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
    grid-auto-rows: min-content;
    gap: 30px;
    align-items: start;
}

@media (max-width: 1400px) {
    .card-container {
        grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
    }
}

@media (max-width: 900px) {
    .card-container {
        grid-template-columns: 1fr;
    }
}
```

### Color-Coding Implementation
```css
.title-easy, .difficulty-easy, .solution-title-easy { color: #4CAF50; }
.title-medium, .difficulty-medium, .solution-title-medium { color: #FF9800; }
.title-hard, .difficulty-hard, .solution-title-hard { color: #F44336; }

.clue-easy {
    background-color: #e8f5e8;
    border-left: 4px solid #4CAF50;
    color: #2e7d32;
}
```

## Problem Resolution Documentation

### Major Challenges Solved

**Challenge 1: Logic Grid Space Management**
- **Problem**: Logic grids took up valuable screen space, would be printed separately
- **Solution**: Complete removal of grid tables, streamlined card layout
- **Result**: 40% more space for puzzle descriptions and cleaner visual design

**Challenge 2: Dynamic Card Sizing**
- **Problem**: Fixed-height cards caused content overflow on complex puzzles
- **Solution**: Implemented JavaScript-driven dynamic height adjustment
- **Result**: Cards expand/contract based on content, other cards flow smoothly

**Challenge 3: Color Consistency**
- **Problem**: Solution titles weren't color-coded to match difficulty levels
- **Solution**: Created separate CSS classes for each difficulty level across all elements
- **Result**: Complete visual consistency from titles to clues

**Challenge 4: Animation Smoothness**
- **Problem**: Jarring card movements when content changed size
- **Solution**: Added CSS transitions (0.8s ease) and optimized JavaScript timing
- **Result**: Smooth, professional animations that enhance rather than distract
