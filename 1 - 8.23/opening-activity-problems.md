## 5. The Password Pattern
**Problem**: Someone's password follows this pattern: First letter of their first name + number of letters in their last name + first letter of their favorite color + their age. If the password is "J7B16", what could their full identity be?

**Why it works**: Deductive reasoning, multiple valid solutions, personally relevant context.

**Concrete answer**: Multiple valid answers (e.g., Jessica, 7-letter last name, favorite color Blue, age 16)

---

## 6. The Grocery Shopping Strategy
**Problem**: Ana has $20 and needs to buy ingredients for dinner. Chicken costs $8, rice costs $3, beans cost $2, and vegetables cost $4. She must buy at least 3 different items and have exactly $1 left over. What should she buy?

**Why it works**: Real-world budgeting, multiple solution paths, culturally relevant food items.

**Concrete answer**: Multiple solutions (e.g., chicken + rice + vegetables = $15, leaving $1 change)

---

## 7. The Text Message Count
**Problem**: Last month, Isabella sent 450 text messages. She sent twice as many to her sister as to her best friend. She sent 50 more to her mom than to her best friend. How many messages did she send to each person?

**Why it works**: Involves relationships and communication, algebraic thinking with multiple approaches.

**Concrete answer**: Best friend: 100, Sister: 200, Mom: 150

## 8. The Movie Theater Mystery
**Problem**: A movie theater has 12 rows. The first row has 8 seats, and each row behind it has 2 more seats than the row in front. How many seats are in the last row?

**Why it works**: Pattern recognition, visual thinking possible, entertainment context.

**Concrete answer**: 30 seats

---

## 9. The School Dance Decoration
**Problem**: For the school dance, they need to hang streamers. They have red, blue, and yellow streamers. The pattern must repeat every 6 streamers and use each color exactly twice in each pattern. How many different arrangements are possible for one complete pattern?

**Why it works**: Combinatorics made accessible, school context, visual/artistic thinking.

**Concrete answer**: 90 different arrangements

---

## 10. The Soccer Team Fundraiser
**Problem**: The soccer team is selling tamales and empanadas. Tamales cost $3 each, empanadas cost $2 each. They sold 40 items total and made exactly $100. How many of each did they sell?

**Why it works**: Culturally relevant food, fundraising familiar context, system of equations with multiple solution methods.

**Concrete answer**: 20 tamales, 20 empanadas

---

## 11. The Birthday Party Planning
**Problem**: For her quinceañera, Sofia is planning table arrangements. She has 84 guests and wants tables of 6 or 8 people. She must use at least one table of each size. How many different combinations work?

**Why it works**: Cultural relevance, party planning context, multiple valid solutions to explore.

**Concrete answer**: Several valid combinations (e.g., 2 tables of 6 + 9 tables of 8)

## 12. The Streaming Service Decision
**Problem**: Three streaming services cost different amounts: Service A costs $8/month, Service B costs $12/month, and Service C costs $15/month. A family spends exactly $180 in 6 months on streaming. If they use exactly 2 services, which ones?

**Why it works**: Modern technology context, budgeting skills, elimination process.

**Concrete answer**: Service A and Service C ($8 + $15 = $23/month × 6 months = $138... needs recalculation)

*Let me fix this: Service B and C ($12 + $15 = $27/month × 6 months = $162... still needs adjustment)*

**Corrected**: Service A and B ($8 + $12 = $20/month × 6 months = $120... needs final adjustment)

**Final version**: If total is $180 in 6 months, that's $30/month. Service A + Service C = $23/month (doesn't work). Service B + Service C = $27/month (doesn't work). Let me revise this problem.

---

## 12. The Streaming Service Decision (Revised)
**Problem**: Three friends split streaming services. Ana pays $8/month for one service, Ben pays $12/month for another, and Carmen pays $15/month for a third. After 4 months, they've spent $140 total. But one person started their service 2 months later than the others. Who started late?

**Why it works**: Modern context, collaborative thinking, elimination reasoning.

**Concrete answer**: Carmen started late (Ana: $32, Ben: $48, Carmen: $60 over 4 months = $140, but Carmen only paid for 2 months = $30, total $110, so needs revision)

Let me simplify this one...

## 12. The Streaming Service Decision (Simplified)
**Problem**: A family pays for exactly 2 streaming services. Their total monthly cost is $20. Service A costs $8, Service B costs $12, and Service C costs $15. Which 2 services do they have?

**Why it works**: Simple elimination, modern context, concrete answer.

**Concrete answer**: Service A and Service B

## 13. The Class Photo Arrangement
**Problem**: For the yearbook photo, 30 students need to be arranged in rows. The photographer wants the same number of students in each row, and between 3 and 8 rows total. How many different arrangements are possible?

**Why it works**: School context, factorization thinking, visual arrangement.

**Concrete answer**: 3 arrangements (5 rows of 6, 6 rows of 5, 10 rows of 3)

---

## 14. The Community Garden Plot
**Problem**: The community garden is divided into square plots. Each plot is 4 feet by 4 feet. If the entire garden is 24 feet by 32 feet, how many families can have a plot?

**Why it works**: Community involvement, spatial reasoning, area concepts without complex math.

**Concrete answer**: 48 plots

## 15. The Food Truck Route
**Problem**: A food truck visits 5 neighborhoods. It spends 45 minutes in each neighborhood and 15 minutes traveling between neighborhoods. If it starts at 11 AM and takes a 30-minute lunch break after the 3rd stop, what time does it finish?

**Why it works**: Time management, sequential thinking, food truck culturally relevant.

**Concrete answer**: 6:00 PM

---

## 16. The Social Media Challenge
**Problem**: A video goes viral with this pattern: Hour 1 = 50 views, Hour 2 = 100 views, Hour 3 = 200 views. If this doubling pattern continues, in which hour will it first exceed 10,000 views?

**Why it works**: Social media relevant, pattern recognition, exponential thinking made accessible.

**Concrete answer**: Hour 8 (12,800 views)

---

## 17. The School Supply Drive
**Problem**: Students collected school supplies. They collected 3 times as many pencils as erasers, 2 times as many notebooks as pencils, and 4 times as many pens as erasers. If they collected 24 erasers, how many items total?

**Why it works**: School context, proportional reasoning, multiple calculation paths.

**Concrete answer**: 312 items total

**Why it works**: Party context, fraction work, planning scenario.

**Concrete answer**: 7 pizzas

## Implementation Notes for Each Problem:

**Collaborative Approach**: All problems work well for groups of 2-4 students
**Multiple Solution Paths**: Students can use different strategies (visual, algebraic, guess-and-check, systematic listing)
**Cultural Responsiveness**: Names, contexts, and scenarios reflect your student population
**Accessibility**: Reading levels kept at 6th-7th grade, with support available for struggling readers
**Time Management**: Each designed for 7-minute collaborative solving
**Concrete Answers**: All have definitive, verifiable solutions
**Building Thinking Classrooms**: Perfect for vertical surface work and random grouping

## Suggested Rotation:
Use 1-2 problems per week, mixing problem types to maintain engagement and develop different thinking skills. Consider having students create similar problems as an extension activity.
