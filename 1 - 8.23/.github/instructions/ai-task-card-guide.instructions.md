# AI Instructions for Digital Task Cards and Skill Checks

**Digital educational materials creation guide for 9th grade English Language Arts with three-tier differentiation**

## Core Implementation Requirements

### Building Thinking Classrooms Integration
- Student choice in difficulty level (students can switch anytime)
- Collaborative problem-solving design
- Rich tasks with multiple entry points
- Visible thinking processes through group work

### Three-Tier Differentiation Structure
- **Easy (gr - 70%)**: On-ramp level, 2nd-4th grade reading complexity
- **Medium (or - 85%)**: Grade-level with scaffolding, 6th-7th grade reading complexity  
- **Hard (rd - 100%)**: Above grade-level, 9th+ grade reading complexity
- All tiers test same skills with appropriate complexity adjustments
- Scaffolding decreases as tier increases

### Digital Implementation Context
- Tasks load into custom digital interface
- 74-minute class periods on A/B rotation schedule
- Students work collaboratively in self-selected difficulty groups
- Teacher circulates providing individual support
- All work completed in-class only (no homework due to AI concerns)

## Class Structure and Timing Templates

### Novel Unit with In-Class Reading (CP)
- Engaging Opening Activity (7 min): Puzzle, riddle, brainteaser
- Audiobook/Reading Section (25-30 min)
- Task Work Time (30-35 min)
- Wrap-Up (5 min)

### Practice-Focused Days (All Classes)
- Engaging Opening Activity (7 min)
- Mini-Lesson or Review (10-15 min)
- Extended Task Work Time (45-50 min)
- Wrap-Up (5 min)

### Skill Check Days (All Classes)
- Engaging Opening Activity (7 min)
- Final Practice/Review (30-40 min)
- Skill Check (15-30 min based on complexity)
- Wrap-Up (remaining time)

## Task Design Requirements

### Universal Requirements for All Tasks
- **Title**: Clear, engaging task name
- **Directions**: Step-by-step instructions in student-friendly language
- **Hints**: 2-3 suggestions that guide without giving answers
- **Time Allocation**: 10-15 minutes completion time (accounting for collaboration and slower work pace)
- **Group Collaboration**: Designed for 2-4 students working together
- **Connection to Skill Checks**: Prepares students for both aligned skill checks without direct practice

### Tier-Specific Task Requirements

#### Easy Level (gr - 70%) Tasks
- **Focus**: Specific, concrete aspects of skill
- **Complexity**: Basic analysis and identification
- **Support**: Sentence stems/frames provided
- **Reading Level**: 2nd-4th grade vocabulary and syntax
- **Example Skill**: Identify character motivation through specific actions

#### Medium Level (or - 85%) Tasks  
- **Focus**: Skill application and comparison
- **Complexity**: Deeper analysis with structured support
- **Support**: Minimal scaffolding, no sentence frames
- **Reading Level**: 6th-7th grade vocabulary and syntax
- **Example Skill**: Compare character motivations across different scenes

#### Hard Level (rd - 100%) Tasks
- **Focus**: Analysis and thematic connections
- **Complexity**: Advanced application requiring synthesis
- **Support**: No scaffolding provided
- **Reading Level**: 9th+ grade vocabulary and syntax
- **Example Skill**: Analyze how character motivations reflect broader themes

### Special Scaffolding Requirements
- **Two of six Easy tasks** must include one carefully chosen sentence frame
- Frame supports structure/organization, not content
- Frame complexity matches 7th-8th grade reading level
- Appears only in tasks, never in skill checks
- Example: "The character's decision to _____ reveals _____."

## Skill Check Design Requirements

### Universal Skill Check Standards
- **Dual Checks Required**: Each task needs TWO aligned skill checks
- **Equal Difficulty**: Both checks test same skills in different ways
- **Different Content**: Use different contexts/examples
- **Independent Completion**: Students work alone
- **Quick Grading**: Maximum 30 seconds grading time (1 minute for Hard level)
- **Objective Criteria**: Concrete, observable success markers
- **Retake Ready**: Need multiple versions at same difficulty level

### Tier-Specific Skill Check Requirements

#### Easy Level (gr - 70%) Skill Checks
- **Response Length**: 1-2 sentences
- **Focus**: Specific, concrete recall
- **Success Criteria**: 2-3 clear, concrete markers
- **Support**: Sentence stems/frames provided
- **Time**: 3-4 minutes completion
- **Example**: "What two specific items do the boys use to start their first fire?"

#### Medium Level (or - 85%) Skill Checks
- **Response Length**: 2-3 sentences  
- **Focus**: Skill application or comparison
- **Success Criteria**: 3-4 clear, concrete markers
- **Support**: No sentence frames
- **Time**: 4-5 minutes completion
- **Example**: "What does Jack's first assembly speech reveal about his approach to leadership?"

#### Hard Level (rd - 100%) Skill Checks
- **Response Length**: 3-4 sentences
- **Focus**: Analysis or thematic connections
- **Success Criteria**: 4-5 clear, concrete markers
- **Support**: No scaffolding
- **Time**: 4-5 minutes completion
- **Example**: "How does one specific object's meaning change between its introduction and the end of Chapter 3?"

## Critical Design Principles

### Preventing Common Failures
- **Questions must require text knowledge**: Cannot be answered through logic alone
- **Avoid telegraphing answers**: Question language shouldn't suggest the response
- **No emotional indicators**: Don't include interpretive language in questions
- **Objective success criteria**: Use observable, concrete markers
- **Appropriate complexity gaps**: Each tier genuinely different, not just reworded

### Quality Control Standards
- **Text-dependent**: Impossible to answer without reading
- **Level-appropriate**: Reading complexity matches tier
- **Culturally responsive**: Honor Hispanic/Brazilian student backgrounds
- **Time-realistic**: Completion possible within allocated minutes
- **Collaboration-friendly**: Tasks work well for group problem-solving

## Success Criteria Development

### Easy Level Criteria Examples
- "Names specific power dynamic"
- "Provides textual example"
- "Links to character action"

### Medium Level Criteria Examples  
- "Shows contrast between two approaches"
- "Identifies specific evidence from text"
- "Explains connection to larger situation"

### Hard Level Criteria Examples
- "Analyzes transformation with specific evidence"
- "Connects to broader thematic significance"
- "Demonstrates understanding of symbolic meaning"

## Digital Interface Considerations

### Content Structure for Loading
- All tasks and checks formatted for digital display
- Clear tier identification for student self-selection
- Embedded collaboration protocols
- Progress tracking integration
- Immediate feedback capability

### Student Experience Design
- Intuitive tier selection process
- Clear completion indicators
- Group formation tools
- Teacher communication features
- Work submission protocols

## Implementation Quality Checks

### Before Digital Loading
- [ ] All tiers test same core skills
- [ ] Success criteria are objective and concrete
- [ ] Time allocations are realistic for collaboration
- [ ] Cultural responsiveness verified
- [ ] Scaffolding appropriate for each tier
- [ ] Both skill checks equally difficult
- [ ] Questions require actual text knowledge
- [ ] No answer hints embedded in questions

### Grading Efficiency Validation
- [ ] Easy checks gradable in 30 seconds
- [ ] Medium checks gradable in 30 seconds
- [ ] Hard checks gradable in 60 seconds maximum
- [ ] Success criteria allow consistent scoring
- [ ] Multiple versions maintain equal difficulty

## Special Adaptations for Digital Environment

### Advantages of Digital Format
- Instant tier switching capability
- Real-time collaboration tools
- Progress tracking and analytics
- Immediate teacher feedback
- Automated organization and storage

### Digital-Specific Design Elements
- Interactive collaboration features
- Progress visualization
- Embedded hint systems
- Teacher dashboard integration
- Student choice tracking

## Vocabulary Integration Requirements

When creating materials that incorporate vocabulary instruction:

### Root-Based Approach
- Focus on Tier 2 academic vocabulary
- Emphasize morphological patterns
- Include Spanish/Portuguese cognates when possible
- Provide context-rich usage examples

### Assessment Integration
- Vocabulary skill checks follow same three-tier structure
- Include multiple question formats per word
- Ensure questions test genuine understanding, not memorization
- Provide varied contexts that require real comprehension

This framework ensures that all digital task cards and skill checks maintain pedagogical integrity while leveraging the advantages of digital delivery and your specific classroom economy and differentiation systems.
