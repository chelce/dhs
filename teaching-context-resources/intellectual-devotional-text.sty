WEEK 1

MONDAY, DAY 1
The Alphabet
In circa 2000 BC, the Egyptian pharaohs realized they had a problem. With each
military victory over their neighbors, they captured and enslaved more prisoners
of war. But the Egyptians could not pass down written orders to these slaves as
they could not read hieroglyphics.
Early writing systems, such as Egyptian hieroglyphics, were extremely
cumbersome and difficult to learn. These systems had thousands of characters,
with each symbol representing an idea or word. Memorizing them could take
years. Only a handful of Egyptians could actually read and write their
complicated script.
Linguists believe that almost all modern alphabets are derived from the
simplified version of hieroglyphics devised by the Egyptians four thousand years
ago to communicate with their slaves. The development of an alphabet, the
writing system used throughout the Western world, changed the way the ancients
communicated.
In the simplified version, each character represented only a sound. This
innovation cut back the number of characters from a few thousand to a few
dozen, making it far easier to learn and use the characters. The complicated
hieroglyphic language was eventually forgotten, and scholars were not able to
translate the characters until the discovery of the Rosetta stone in 1799.
The alphabet was extremely successful. When the Egyptian slaves eventually
migrated back to their home countries, they took the writing system with them.
The alphabet spread across the Near East, becoming the foundation for many
writing systems in the area, including Hebrew and Arabic. The Phoenicians, an
ancient civilization of seaborne traders, spread the alphabet to the tribes they
encountered along the Mediterranean coast. The Greek and Roman alphabets, in
turn, were based on the ancient Phoenician script. Today most Western
languages, including English, use the Roman alphabet.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Several letters in modern-day English are direct descendents of ancient
Egyptian characters. For instance, the letter B derives from the Egyptian
character for the word house.
2. The most recent edition of the Oxford English Dictionary contains 171,476
words in current usage, among the most of any language.
TUESDAY, DAY 2
Ulysses
James Joyce's Ulysses (1922) is widely regarded as the greatest novel written in
English in the twentieth century. It retells Homer's Odyssey in the context of a
single day-June 16, 1904-in Dublin, Ireland, recasting Homer's great hero
Odysseus in the unlikely guise of Leopold Bloom, an aging, cuckolded ad
salesman who spends the day running errands and making various business
appointments before he returns home at long last.
Though Bloom seems unassuming and ordinary, he emerges as a heroic figure,
displaying compassion, forgiveness, and generosity toward virtually everyone
in the odd cast of characters he meets. In his mundane and often unnoticed
deeds, he practices an everyday heroism that is perhaps the only heroism
possible in the modern world. And despite the fact that he always feels like an
outsider-he is a Jew in overwhelmingly Catholic Ireland Bloom remains
optimistic and dismisses his insecurities.
Ulysses is celebrated for its incredibly rich portraits of characters, its mind-
boggling array of allusions to other literary and cultural works, and its many
innovations with language. Throughout the course of the novel, Joyce flirts with
literary genres and forms ranging from drama to advertising copy to Old
English. The novel is perhaps most famous for its extensive use of stream-of-
consciousness narrative-Joyce's attempt to render the inner thoughts of his
characters exactly as they occur, with no effort to impose order or organization.
This technique became a hallmark of modernist literature and influenced
countless other writers, such as Virginia Woolf and William Faulkner, who also
experimented with it in their works.
Not surprisingly, Ulysses poses a difficult journey for the reader, especially its
famous last chapter, which recounts the thoughts of Bloom's wife, Molly.
Molly's reverie goes on for more than 24,000 words yet is divided into only eight
mammoth sentences. Despite the challenge it poses, the chapter shows Joyce at
his most lyrical, especially in the final lines, which reaffirm Molly's love for her
husband despite her infidelity:
and then he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and first 1
put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my
breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes I said yes I
will Yes.
ADDITIONAL FACT
1. Ulysses was banned for obscenity in the United States for nearly twelve years
because ofits (mostly indirect) sexual imagery.
WEDNESDAY, DAY 3
Lascaux Cave Paintings
The cave paintings at Lascaux are among the earliest known works of art. They
were discovered in 1940 near the village of Montignac in central France when
four boys stumbled into a cave. Inside they found a series of rooms with nearly
1,500 paintings of animals that were between 15,000 and 17,000 years old.
There are several theories regarding the function of the paintings. A natural
feature of the cave may have suggested the shape of an animal to a prehistoric
observer who then added highlights to relay his vision to others. Since many of
the paintings are located in inaccessible parts of the cave, they may have been
used for magical practices. Possibly, prehistoric people believed that the act of
drawing animals, especially with a high degree of accuracy, would bring the
beasts under their control or increase their numbers in times of scarcity.
The animals are outlined or portrayed in silhouette. They are often shown in
what is called twisted perspective, that is, with their heads in profile but their
horns facing front. Many of the images include dots, linear patterns, and other
designs that may carry symbolic meaning.
The most magnificent chamber of the cave, known as the Great Hall of the Bulls,
contains a painted narrative. From left to right, the pictures depict the chase and
capture of a bison herd.
As soon as the paintings had been examined and identified as Paleolithic, the
caves were opened to the public in 1948. By 1955, however, it became
increasingly evident that exposure to as many as 1,200 visitors per day was
taking its toll on the works inside. Although protective measures were taken, the
site closed in 1963. In order to satisfy public demand, a life-sized replica of the
cave was completed in 1983, only 200 meters from the original.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. The cave painters were conscious of visual perspective; they painted figures
high on the wall, styled so that they would not appear distorted to the viewer
below.
2. The only human figure depicted in the cave appears in the Shaft of the Dead
Man. The factthatit is drawn more crudely than the animals suggests that they
did not think it was endowed with magical properties.
THURSDAY, DAY 4
Cloning
In 1997, a baby sheep named Dolly introduced the world to reproductive
cloning. She was a clone because she and her mother shared the same nuclear
DNA; in other words, their cells carried the same genetic material. They were
like identical twins reared generations apart.
Scientists at the Roslin Institute in Scotland created Dolly by a process called
nuclear transfer. Taking the genetic material from an adult donor cell, they
transferred it into an unfertilized egg whose genetic material had been removed.
In Dolly's case, the donor cell came from the mammary gland of a six-year-old
Finn Dorset ewe. The researchers then gave the egg an electric shock, and it
began dividing into an embryo.
One of the reasons Dolly's creation was so astounding was that it proved to the
scientific community that a cell taken from a specialized part of the body could
be used to create a whole new organism. Before Dolly, almost all scientists
believed that once a cell became specialized it could only produce other
specialized cells: A heart cell could only make heart cells, and a liver cell could
only make liver cells. But Dolly was made entirely from a cell extracted from
her mother's mammary gland, proving that specialized cells could be completely
reprogrammed.
In many ways, Dolly was not like her mother. For example, her telomeres were
too short. Telomeres are thin strands ofprotein that cap off the ends of
chromosomes, the structures that carry genes. Although no one is sure exactly
what telomeres do, they seem to help protect and repair our cells. As we age, our
telomeres get shorter and shorter. Dolly received her mother's six-year-old
telomeres, so from birth, Dolly's telomeres were shorter than the average lamb
her age. Although Dolly appeared to be mostly normal, she was put to sleep in
2004 at the age of six, after suffering from lung cancer and crippling arthritis.
The average Finn Dorset sheep lives to age eleven or twelve.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Since 1997, cattle, mice, goats, and pigs have been successfully cloned using
nuclear transfer.
2. The success rate for cloning is very low in all species. Published studies report
that about 1 percent of reconstructed embryos survive birth. But since
unsuccessful attempts largely go unreported, the actual number might be much
lower.
3. Before she died, Dolly was the mother ofsix lambs, all bred the old fashioned
way.
4. A group ofKorean researchers claimed to have cloned a human embryo in
1998, but their experiment was terminated at the 4-cell stage, so there was no
evidence of their success.
FRIDAY, DAY 5
The Basics
Music is organized sound that can be replicated through imitation or notation.
Music is distinct from noise in that the sounds of a door creaking open or
fingernails on a blackboard are irregular and disorganized. The sound waves that
map these noises are complex and cannot be heard as identifiable pitches.
Some of the basic ways that we analyze musical sounds are:
PITCH: How high or how low a sound is to the ear. Pitch is measured
technically by the frequency of a sound wave, or how often waves repeat
themselves. In western music there are twelve unique pitches (C, C-sharp or D-
flat, D, D-sharp or E-flat, E, F, F-sharp or G-flat, G, G-sharp or A-flat, A, A-
sharp or B-flat, and B). The pitches followed by sharps or flats are called
accidentals, and they are most easily described as the black keys on the piano
keyboard. They are located musically, one half step between the two pitches on
either side of them. For example, D-sharp and E-flat have the same pitch. When
referring to pitches in the context of notated, or written music, they are called
notes.
SCALE: A stepwise arrangement of pitches (for example, C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C)
that often serves as the basis for a melody. A piece, or a portion of a piece, will
often use only notes found in a particular scale. Western music primarily uses the
major scale or the minor scale, in one form or another. To most people, the major
scale, because of its particular arrangement of pitches, has the quality of
sounding "bright," "happy," or "positive" A minor scale, likewise, is usually
described as "dark," "sad," or "pessimistic."
KEY: An arrangement or system of pitches, usually based on one of the major or
minor scales, that is meant to serve as a reference point and a guiding force of a
melody. The tonic of a key is often the starting and ending point for a piece
written in a particular key-so if a piece is in E major, then the pitch E will serve
as the piece's tonal center.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Allofthese basic elements can be notated on the staff, which is a repeating set
offivepardllel horizontal lines. Often it is divided into measures to indicate
metric divisions in the piece and marked at the beginning of each staffof the
page with a clef to indicate reference points for ident fyingpitches.
2. When a piece strays from its basic key, this is called modulation. Keys are
indicated in written music by a key signature at the beginning of each staff.
3. There are hundreds of scales used in the world's many different musical
cultures. In India, music played on the sitar and other instruments chooses
pitches from a collection of twenty-two possibilities, with the distances
between scale steps sometimes larger and sometimes smaller than those used in
Western music. This can make differences between pitches extremely subtle
and demands a high virtuosity from Indian classical musicians.
SATURDAY, DAY 6
Appearance and Reality
Throughout its history, one of the great themes of philosophy has been the
distinction between appearance and reality. This distinction was central to the
thought of the earliest philosophers, called the Presocratics, because they lived
before Socrates.
The Presocratics believed that the ultimate nature of reality was vastly different
from the way it ordinarily appeared to them. For instance, one philosopher
named Thales held that appearances notwithstanding, all reality was ultimately
composed of water; Heraclitus thought the world was built from fire. Further,
Heraclitus maintained that everything was constantly in motion. Another thinker,
Parmenides, insisted that nothing actually moved and that all apparent motion
was an illusion.
The Presocratics took seriously the possibility that all of reality was ultimately
made up of some more fundamental substance. And they suspected that
uncritical, everyday observation tends to present us with a misleading picture of
the world. For these reasons, their thinking is often considered a precursor to
modern science as well as philosophy.
Many later philosophers-including Plato, Spinoza, and Leibniz-followed in this
tradition and presented alternative models of reality, which they claimed were
closer to the truth than ordinary, commonsense views of the world.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. The distinction between appearance and reality is also central to the venerable
philosophical tradition known as skepticism.
2. Inznzanuel Kant also addressed the difference between appearance and reality.
He distinguished between things we experience and what he called a "thing-in-
itself."
SUNDAY, DAY 7
Torah
The Torah is the name generally given to the first five books of the Hebrew
Bible, or the Five Books of Moses. Christians refer to these books as the Old
Testament. The word Torah can also refer to the entire breadth of Jewish law
encompassing several texts as well as oral traditions.
The Five Books of Moses are the basis for the 613 laws that govern the Jewish
faith, and they are the foundation for the world's three great monotheistic faiths-
Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. They are as follows:
GENESIS: Tells the story of creation as well as the history of the Israelites,
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and their families
EXODUS: Recounts the exodus from Egypt to Canaan, including Moses
receiving the Ten Commandments
LEVITICUS: Contains the rules and practices of worship NUMBERS: Relates
the journey of the Israelites in the wilderness
DEUTERONOMY: Consists of speeches made by Moses at the end of his life
that recount Israelite history and ethical teachings
The five books are traditionally believed to have been given to Moses on Mount
Sinai. Alternative theories claim the beginning of the Torah was given on Mount
Sinai but that the revelation continued throughout Moses's life.
Historically, archaeologists have argued that the Torah was written sometime
between the tenth and sixth centuries BC. Proponents of the Documentary
Hypothesis, which according to Orthodox Jews is heretical, claim that the
original five books came from four sources, eventually compiled into one by a
fifth author or redactor. The arguments in favor of this theory are the multiple
names used for God, varying styles of writing, and the repetition of stories.
From the beginning, the Torah was accompanied by an oral tradition, which was
necessary for its complete understanding. Although it was thought to be
blasphemous to write the oral tradition down, the necessity for doing so
eventually became apparent, leading to the creation of the Mishna. Later, as
rabbis discussed and debated these two texts, the Talmud was written in order to
compile their arguments.
The Jewish tradition uses the text of the Torah to derive innumerable laws and
customs. Rabbinic scholars have spent entire lifetimes parsing every word for
meaning.
ADDITIONAL FACT
1. Torah scrolls, written in Hebrew by hand, contain 304,805 letters and may
take more than a year to produce by hand. Ifa single mistake is made, the entire
scroll becomes invalid.

WEEK 2

MONDAY, DAY 1
Hammurabi's Code of Laws
Hammurabi was a king of Babylonia, an ancient civilization in present-day Iraq.
He ruled for forty-three years and conquered several rival nations, but he is most
famous as history's first lawyer. Near the end of his reign, Hammurabi issued
one of the first written codes of law in recorded history, which spelled out the
rules for his citizens and the punishments for lawbreakers. The very concept of
laws that applied to everyone was an unheard of novelty in Hammurabi's time,
when most societies were governed only by the whims of their despotic rulers.
The code itself, however, was extremely cruel by modern standards. Hammurabi
prescribed the death penalty for even minor infractions. Women who entered a
tavern, men who harbored runaway slaves, and wives who left their husbands
without good cause were all subject to capital punishment. The crude code
reflected the superstitions of its ancient society. In disputes between Babylonian
citizens, Hammurabi's code called for the accused to jump into a river. If he was
guilty, he would drown. But if he was innocent, he would "escape unhurt," and
the accuser would be put to death for making a false charge.
The king's scribes wrote the laws on a black stone pillar that was dedicated to the
god ofjustice and displayed in public. In the inscription, Hammurabi called on
"all coming generations" to observe the laws, and not to "alter the law of the land
which I have given" Future kings, Hammurabi said, must uphold the rule of law
rather than govern according to their own impulses. The notion that rulers could
not arbitrarily change the laws governing their citizens was a revolutionary
concept. Respect for the rule of law remains one of the fundamental hallmarks of
successful governments.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. The pillar that displayed Hammurabi's laws was unearthed in 1901 by a
French archaeologist and now stands in the Louvre Museum in Paris.
2. Hammurabi's code was inscribed in cuneiform, a complex writing system used
by most ancient civilizations in the Near East. Modern scholars were unable to
decode cuneiform characters until 1835.
3. Babylonian scientists used a counting system based on the number sixty,
which is why minutes have sixty seconds.
TUESDAY, DAY 2
Ernest Hemingway
Among the major American writers of the twentieth century, few have been as
influential or imitated as Ernest Hemingway (1899-1961)-and few have had as
many detractors. Renowned for his novels and short stories, Hemingway became
such a public figure during his life-and constructed such an extensive mythology
around himself-that it is sometimes difficult to separate the legend from the
reality.
Born in Oak Park, Illinois, in 1899, Hemingway had writerly aspirations early
on; by eighteen, he was employed as a reporter for the Kansas City Star. Within
months, he landed a position as a Red Cross ambulance driver on the Italian
front in World War I, where he was wounded. After the war, he spent several
years in Paris in the company of Gertrude Stein and other expatriate American
writers of the so-called Lost Generation, who were disillusioned by the war's
brutality. In Paris Hemingway refined his trademark stylea repetitive, stripped-
down, self-consciously masculine prose that is deceptive in its seeming
simplicity.
After writing a number of short stories based on his boyhood summers in upper
Michigan and his later travels through Europe, Hemingway penned his first
major novel, The Sun Also Rises (1926). This book, about a disaffected young
American whiling away time in Spain and France, brought Hemingway instant
acclaim. He followed with A Farewell to Arms (1929), a tragic World War I
romance between an American ambulance driver and an English nurse, and For
Whom the Bell Tolls (1940), a tale of guerrillas in the Spanish Civil War that
was inspired by Hemingway's own work as a journalist during the conflict. The
protagonist of the latter novel epitomizes what many have termed the
"Hemingway code hero"a stoic, disillusioned male who exhibits grace and
nobility in the face of violence and adversity.
As his fame increased, Hemingway earned-and cultivated-a reputation for
writing only about war, bullfighting, hunting, big-game fishing, and other overtly
masculine topics. Though some critics dismissed Hemingway's work as macho
posturing, the undeniably masterful storytelling of his novella The Old Man and
the Sea (1952) earned him the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954. Even with this
crowning achievement, Hemingway spent his last years mired in depression and
declining health, ultimately taking his own life with a shotgun in 1961. His
influence on the style of the modern novel, however, remains monumental.
ADDITIONAL FACT
1. The annual Imitation Hemingway Contest draws hundreds ofentries thatpay
mock homage to the author's unmistakable style. Past honorees include pieces
entitled The Old Man and the Flea and For Whom the Cash Flows.
WEDNESDAY, DAY 3
Bust of Nefertiti
One of the most famous works of Egyptian art, the limestone bust of Nefertiti
was discovered in 1912 by German archeologist Ludwig Borchardt near the
modern Egyptian town of Tell el-Amarna. It was found in the workshop of the
ancient sculptor Thutmose and smuggled out of the country disguised as pieces
of broken pottery.
Nefertiti was the most important queen of Pharaoh Amenhotep IV, who ruled
Egypt from 1353 to 1335 BC. During his rule, the pharaoh changed his name to
Akhenaton"one who serves Aten, the Sun God"-and embraced a new,
monotheistic religion that emphasized ethics. Nefertiti was granted high status,
equal nearly to that of her husband. Some scholars believe that she was the force
behind the new religion and that she even ruled as co-regent for some time. After
Akhenaton's death, nearly all traces of him and his powerful wife were wiped
out, perhaps by the priests whose religion they had rejected.
Nefertiti's bust, which is nearly 3,400 years old and about twenty inches tall, was
found in nearly perfect condition. Only the earlobes were chipped. The work was
left unfinished, however, since the left eye socket seems never to have been
filled. It is possible that Thutmose used the bust as a model for his pupils.
Whether the bust captures the queen's likeness or portrays an ideal beauty is
open to question.
A controversy erupted in 2003 when Joann Fletcher, a British archeologist
funded by the Discovery Channel, identified a previously discovered mummy as
Nefertiti. Although she offered substantial evidence, Egyptian authorities
rejected her claims.
The bust can be seen today at the Altes Museum in Berlin. It remains not only
one of the best known works of Egyptian art but also a model of feminine
beauty, giving new significance to Nefertiti's name, which translates to "the
beautiful one is come"
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. In the last days of World War II, the bust ofNefertiti was moved out of the
Soviet sector of Berlin, creating a dispute over its ownership. It was returned
sixty-six years later, in 2005.
2. A Google search for Nefertiti turns up 472, 000 hits, a testimony to the lasting
power of her image in the twenty-first century.
3. A pair of Hungarian artists calling themselves Little Warsaw recently stirred a
controversy by setting the bust ofNefertiti atop a headless sculpture ofa woman
in a transparent garment.
THURSDAY, DAY 4
Eratosthenes
Many scientists in Ancient Greece believed the world was round. But none of
them knew how big it was until the third century BC when Eratosthenes (276194
BC), chief librarian of Alexandria, devised an ingenious way to measure the
earth's size.
Eratosthenes knew of a special well near Syene, Egypt. At noon on June 21, the
longest day of the year, the sun's rays penetrated all the way to the bottom of the
well. This meant that the sun was directly overhead. Eratosthenes realized that if
the sun was directly overhead in Syene, then its rays must be hitting at an angle
in Alexandria, which was due north. If he could measure the angle by which the
sun was off center, then he would have the clue he needed to extrapolate the size
of the earth. So, at noon on June 21 in Alexandria, he took a measuring stick and
captured the angle cast by its shadow.
Eratosthenes knew that the angle of the shadow was equivalent to the angle
formed by the two cities and the center of the earth. So, he divided the size of
that angle by 360, the number of degrees in a circle, to determine the fraction of
the earth that separated the two cities. The answer was one-fiftieth. In other
words, if you walked back and forth between Syene and Alexandria fifty times,
then you would have walked the equivalent of the earth's circumference.
All that remained was to measure the precise distance between the two cities.
Eratosthenes hired a pacer, a professional walker trained in taking perfectly
equal steps. From the measurements of the pacer, Eratosthenes estimated the
circumference of earth to be 24,700 miles. Today, using the exact same
principles developed by Eratosthenes 2,000 years ago, modern instruments
estimate the distance around the equator to be 24,902 miles.
In Eratosthenes's time, the known world extended from Spain to India. He
believed that a vast ocean covered the rest of the world. If it weren't for the
enormity of the ocean, Eratosthenes thought it would be possible to sail from
Spain to India by heading west. It was this idea that inspired Chistopher
Columbus to undertake his famous voyage in 1492.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Eratosthenes was the first historian to seriously attempt to put historical event-
in chronological order. We use his dates for most of ancient history.
2. We also owe to Eratosthenes many modern concepts like longitude, latitude,
musical scales, and prime numbers.
3. Other scientists in Eratosthenes's time nicknamed him Beta, and it wasn't
because he was the coolest boy in his fraternity. Eratosthenes had so many
interests that his contemporaries considered him a dabbler. To them, he was
second-class, a beta.
FRIDAY, DAYS
Melody
Melody, often referred to in everyday speech as the tune, is perhaps the most
immediately recognizable element of music. A melody can be played on one
instrument or many and, along with harmony and rhythm, is considered one of
the three basic elements of all music.
A melody is a succession of pitches arranged in a tuneful sequence. The pitches
make some sort of coherent sense or seem to belong together. Melody is distinct
from harmony in that melody refers to several notes played one after another, not
sounded as in polyphony.
Over time, the definition of melody has grown to include sequences of notes that
would have seemed adventurous or even harsh to the ears of older composers.
Mozart, Schubert, and Sibelius are held up as melody-making geniuses. On the
other hand, modernists like Stravinsky wrote melodies-for example, the haunting
tune that starts his ballet, Rite of Spring-that many composers of the eighteenth
and nineteenth centuries, and indeed, even some audiences today, would
consider unmelodic noise.
Usually melodies are divided into shorter musical units called phrases. These
phrases generally end at resting points that are called cadences. Often the
phrases that usually comprise the overall structure of a melody give the
impression of a question and answer. One part of the melody poses a musical
idea, and another completes it. If a phrase ends on a note that indicates an
unresolved, or incomplete-sounding cadence, the whole phrase is referred to as
an antecedent. Likewise, the following phrase with its complete-sounding
cadence is referred to as a consequent.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. In the Middle Ages, many composers would often share simple stock
melodies such as the fifteenth-century French tune `Z'homme arme"(`The
ArmedMan') as the central themes to their pieces.
2. More modern melodies, like "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star," have been shared
in the same way, but in modern times a much higher premium has been placed
on the talent that goes into writing an original melody.
3. The practice of arranging a melody or an entire piece for a large ensemble of
different instruments is called orchestration. There are entire conservatory
courses dedicated to this subject, and some composers are respected
particularly for their ability to orchestrate.
SATURDAY, DAY 6
Socrates
Widely considered the founder of Western philosophy, Socrates (469-399 BC)
never wrote a single book. We know of him only secondhand, from what other
people wrote about him.
Born in Athens, Greece, in the fifth century BC, Socrates distinguished himself
as a soldier in one of Athens's many wars, and afterward became a curious figure
in Athenian society. He would converse with whomever he could find, especially
the young men of the city. Unlike the Sophists-paid teachers who traveled the
country teaching young men rhetoric and other political skills-Socrates did not
receive payment, and more important, he claimed to have nothing to teach!
Socrates said he had no actual knowledge and that if he was wiser than others, it
was only because he was aware of his own ignorance.
Most of what we know about Socrates comes from his greatest student, Plato
(427-347 BC). Many scholars believe that Plato's earlier dialogues are the most
accurate representation of the historical Socrates and the way he treated
philosophy. In these dialogues, Socrates typically confronts a fellow Athenian
who claims to know something-for instance, the nature of justice. Socrates then
proceeds to prove his neighbor does not know what he claims at all.
In 399 BC, Socrates was put on trial for corrupting the youth of Athens with his
teachings. At his trial-recorded by Plato in the dialogue Apology-Socrates made
his famous claim that the unexamined life is not worth living. He pleaded his
innocence, but was convicted. Socrates was put to death by being forced to drink
hemlock, a poison. His last hours, spent discussing philosophy with his friends
and admirers, are movingly documented in Plato's dialogue Phaedo.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. The Socratic Method, still used by professors in many law schools, is based
on Socrates's style of aggressively questioning his students.
2. Many ofSocrates' contemporaries remarked on how ugly he was.
3. The comic poetAristophanes (448-380 BC) pokes fun at Socrates in his play
The Clouds.
SUNDAY, DAY 7
Noah
Noah is the remarkable figure in the Genesis flood story. According to this story,
God surveyed creation and became angry at mankind's sins. He regretted
creating humans and resolved to destroy them all. Before doing so, however,
God noticed Noah.
Noah was blameless and God decided to save him from certain destruction. God
told Noah that in seven days he would make it rain for forty days and forty
nights, causing a great and terrible flood. Noah was instructed to build an ark
large enough to hold himself, his wife, his three sons and their wives, and a pair
(one male and one female) of every animal that existed. In this way, Noah would
be able to replenish the earth.
Noah followed God's instructions, loading the animals and his family into the
ark. After forty days, the rains ended, but the ground was still submerged. In
order to determine when the waters had receded, Noah opened a window and
sent out a dove.
Finally, after 150 days at sea and another 100 grounded on Mount Ararat, the
land was dry enough for Noah to begin the replenishing process. Noah emptied
his ark, allowing the animals to mate. God then told Noah that he, too, should
"be fruitful and multiply" (Genesis 8:17). God also promised Noah that he would
never again destroy humankind and symbolized this covenant with the
appearance of a rainbow.
Christian and Jewish historians and theologians give slightly different
interpretations to the Noah story. For Christians, Noah represents an ideal faith
in God-marked by trust and obedience and for which Noah and his family were
saved. For Jewish interpreters, Noah represents a reluctant faith marked by Noah
being one of the last to enter the ark as a sign of reluctance. This suggests his
faith may not have been so strong. Despite their differences, both traditions view
Noah and the flood as critical expressions of the religious narratives.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. The story ofNoah includes the first appearance of wine in the Bible. After the
flood, Noah gets drunk and his sons discover him uncovered.
2. God's command to Noah, "Be fruitful and multiply,"is also given to Adam and
Eve [Genesis 1:281 and Jacob [Genesis 35:11].

WEEK 3

MONDAY, DAY I
Sparta vs. Athens: The Battle for the Ancient
World
Sparta, a small city in the rugged mountains of southern Greece, fielded the most
feared military in the ancient world. Spartan soldiers, hardened by grueling
training that began at birth, never lost a battle in the bloody conflicts that raged
almost constantly between the small city-states of ancient Greece. To build this
remarkable army, elders in Sparta tested every newborn for weakness and
deformities. Babies deemed unlikely to become strong soldiers were tossed into
a gorge. For those that passed the test, training was cruel and relentless. The
Greek historian and essayist Plutarch wrote that for many of the Spartan soldiers
marching to battle was a relief: "For the Spartans, actual war was a holiday
compared to their tough training."
The rivalry between militaristic Sparta and its neighbor Athens dominated the
history of ancient Greece. Athens, the birthplace of democracy, was a farless
rigid society. Unlike Sparta, where there was little time for culture, Athens was
home to some of the most extraordinary accomplishments of philosophy, art, and
science in human history. The playwrights Aeschylus, Aristophanes, Euripides,
and Sophocles, as well as philosophers Aristotle, Plato, and Socrates were born
in Athens during the city's golden age in the fifth century BC.
While Athens and Sparta temporarily joined forces to defeat two attempted
Persian invasions, they spent much of the classical period competing for the
leadership of the Hellenic world. When the cities fought, as they did repeatedly
between about 550 and 350 BC, it was a clash of civilizations in the fullest
sense. While Sparta's famed soldiers held the advantage on land, Athens made
up the difference with its sea power. The rivalry came to an abrupt end when
Philip of Macedonia invaded from the north. The Greek city-states were
swallowed up into the empire that Philip and his son, Alexander the Great,
extended over much of Greece and Asia.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Sparta was the capital ofthe Greek region ofLaconia. The word laconic in
modern English is derived from the taciturn attitude ofhardened Spartan
soldiers.
2. To prove their toughness, Spartan boys competed to see how much whipping
they could endure.
3. Many ofthe buildings on theAcropolis in Athens, including the famous
Parthenon, were constructed during the city's golden age in the fifth century
BC.
TUESDAY, DAY 2
The Harlem Renaissance
The Harlem Renaissance, or New Negro movement as it was originally
christened, was a flourishing of African-American literature and art in the
Harlem neighborhood of New York City in the 1920s and early 1930s. The stage
for this rebirth was set when millions of newly freed southern blacks, after
enduring the hardships of slavery and Reconstruction in the 1800s, moved to
New York and other northern cities in an exodus known as the Great Migration.
By the end of World War I, a poor but culturally vibrant black community had
taken root in Harlem.
Much of the foundation of the Harlem Renaissance was set by the African-
American historian and social theorist W. E. B. DuBois, famous for his
sociological treatise The Souls of Black Folk (1903) and for his role in the
founding of the NAACP in 1909. DuBois asserted a new sense of black cultural
consciousness and pride, inspiring a generation of young writers and artists to
create a distinctive African-American voice.
One of the leading writers of the Harlem Renaissance was James Weldon
Johnson, who penned the novel Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man (1912)
and the celebrated collection of verse sermons entitled God's Trombones (1927).
Johnson was followed by Nella Larsen and Zora Neale Hurston, whose
respective novels Passing (1929) and Their Eyes Were Watching God (1937)
were among the first critically acclaimed major literary works by African-
American women.
The Harlem Renaissance produced an especially rich body of poetry. Whereas
some of the movement's poets, such as Countee Cullen, relied on traditional
forms, others, such as Langston Hughes, incorporated rhythms from the newly
burgeoning genre of jazz music into their works. Such links between the music
and literature of the Harlem Renaissance were inextricable, and major figures in
the two fields inspired one another throughout the movement.
In the 1930s, the Harlem Renaissance waned as the Great Depression hit the
black community in New York particularly hard. Nonetheless, the new styles and
themes pioneered during the era endured, paving the way for Ralph Ellison,
Richard Wright, Lorraine Hansberry, Toni Morrison, Alice Walker, and others
among the new generations of African-American novelists, poets, and
playwrights.
ADDITIONAL FACT
1. The Harlem Renaissance era also saw the emergence of a number of notable
black painters, including Palmer Hayden, Lois Mailou Jones, and William H.
Johnson.
WEDNESDAY, DAY 3
The Parthenon
Commissioned by the famous statesman Pericles, the Parthenon was constructed
between 447 and 432 BC to celebrate the victory of the Greeks over the
Persians. Situated over the site of an earlier temple on the Acropolis in Athens, it
was dedicated to Athena Parthenos, the patron deity of the city. The building is
one of the most well-preserved Greek temples in existence.
According to the ancient author Plutarch, the Parthenon was built by the
architects Ictinus and Callicrates. The thirty-eight-foot effigy inside was created
by the classical sculptor Phidias, who also supervised the extensive sculpture of
the structure's exterior.
Ancient Greek temples were generally rectangular and accessible from all sides
by stairs. Many, like the Parthenon, had columns that extended around the
periphery. When building temples, the Greeks tended to follow the rules of one
of three architectural orders-Doric, Ionic, or Corinthian. The orders are easily
recognizable by their differing proportions and their capitals-the carved tops of
their columns. Unlike most Greek temples that were built according to the rules
of one particular order, the Parthenon combined elements of two-the Doric and
Ionic. Its architects also made use of optical refinements, that is, slight
distortions that enhanced the appearance of the building. For example, the base
of the building and the roofline gently bow upward because if they were
perfectly straight, the naked eye would perceive them as sagging. Similarly the
columns are thicker toward the bottom, a refinement that makes them appear
taller to a viewer standing at their base.
Originally, the Parthenon had a wooden ceiling and a tiled roof, and it was
painted in bright colors. Square reliefs or metopes ran around the temple above
the columns and depicted mythological battles that served as metaphors for the
Greek victory over the Persians. A continuous frieze illustrating the annual
festival of Athena Parthenos appeared beneath and behind the columns on the
four walls of the building itself.
The Parthenon was used as a house of worship for many centuries after the fall
of Athens. It was converted into a church in the sixth century, then into a mosque
by the Turks who conquered Greece in 1458. During a battle in 1687, a Venetian
shell landed on a Turkish powder keg stored in the temple and destroyed much
of the building.
In 1801, Lord Elgin, the British ambassador to the Ottoman Court in Istanbul,
received permission to ship the most well-preserved of the Parthenon's
sculptures to England, where he eventually sold them to the British government.
Today they can be seen at the British Museum despite efforts on the part of the
Greeks to have the works returned. The temple itself has been visited by
countless tourists since the Greeks regained control of Athens in 1832.
THURSDAY, DAY 4
The Solar System
In grade school, we were taught that the solar system consists of the sun, nine
planets, and their moons. It's not that simple.
No one really knows how many planets there are because there is no settled
scientific definition of a planet. All astronomers agree upon the validity of the
four terrestrial planetsMercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars-and the four gaseous
giants-Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune-but arctic Pluto is a matter of great
dispute.
Pluto is about two-thirds the size of our moon and takes 248 years to orbit the
sun. The tiny ice planet travels in a strange elliptical orbit on a different plane
than the other eight. Its coldness, distance from the other planets, and warped
path around the sun has led many scientists to believe that it is really a comet in
the Kuiper Belt, a region of icy debris on the outskirts of the solar system.
Pluto has a recently discovered rival on the Kuiper Belt, a hunk of frozen rock
officially referred to as 2003 UB313 but informally called Xena. The object is
three times farther from the sun than Pluto and has an even stranger 560-year
orbit, tilted 45 degrees off the plane of the rest of the planets. But 2003 UB313 is
larger than Pluto, and many scientists feel that if Pluto deserves to be called a
planet, then it does, too.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Two other large frozen objects in the Kuiper Belt-Quaoar and Sedna-are
almost as big as Pluto. They may become the eleventh and twe6rth planets.
2. Astronomer Michael E. Brown discovered 2003 UB313 and nicknamed
itXena after the TV show starring Lucy Lawless as an ancient Greek warrior
princess. He hopes to make Xena the official name.
3. Our solar system has 153 known moons, but that number is highly contested.
4. Seven moons in the solar system are larger than Pluto. This includes Jupiter's
lo, which has an atmosphere and active volcanoes.
FRIDAY, DAY 5
Harmony
Music may start with a melody, but harmony is what gives it color. Harmony
refers to the sounding of two or more different pitches in unison, but the
mechanics of harmony are vast and complicated, and many theorists have spent
the better part of their careers analyzing it.
The distance between two notes is referred to as an interval, and intervals are
expressed numerically. For example, the distance from A to E is called a fifth
The earliest polyphonic music was written in the Middle Ages, and at that point
composers favored the hollowsounding intervals of the fourth (i.e., C to F or D
to G) and the fifth. Therefore, melodies would be followed by a parallel
harmonic line one fourth or one fifth below.
By the Renaissance, however, the triad had become the main unit of harmony,
remained so for centuries, and still is in many types of music. Triads are chords,
or a combination of three or more notes heard simultaneously or in close
succession, based on the interval of the third (i.e., E to G or B to D). The precise
intervals that make up chords are what give them the quality of being major
(bright, happy-sounding) or minor (dark, sad-sounding). The notes that make up
a triad can also be rearranged to create an inversion, which is another tool that is
used to vary harmony.
Harmony has many functions: to "add clothing" to a piece of music, to give
music more depth, to echo or complement a melody line, or just to provide a
grounded accompaniment beneath a melody. Harmony that pleases the ear or
seems stable or at rest is called consonance, while that which sounds harsh,
unfamiliar, or unstable is called dissonance. Without the instability of temporary
dissonance, tonal music would be boring; without the stability of consonance, it
would be unsatisfying. The idea of what is consonant, or acceptable to our ears,
has broadened over the course of music history. Even the question of whether
consonance is essential has become debatable.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Johann Sebstian Bach was known to construct masterful harmonies in his
choral works, and in the twentieth century, Claude Debussy's works were often
driven by lush, shifting harmonies rather than by their melodies.
2. Sixth-century philosopher Pythagoras believed that the 'purest" harmonies
were based on mathematical ratios like 2:1, 3:2, and 4:3. He formulated this
theory while listening to the sounds produced by blacksmiths hammering
anvils ofvarious sizes at the same time.
3. The word harmony comes from the Greek harmonia, which means "fastening"
or "to join."
SATURDAY, DAY 6
Plato
Plato (429-347 BC) was born in fifth-century Athens to a wealthy family. A
young Athenian of his station would have been expected to pursue politics, but
instead Plato followed the path of his mentor, Socrates (470-399 BC), and
became a philosopher.
Plato's philosophical writings are dialogues in which two or more characters
discuss a philosophical issue. The main character in most of Plato's dialogues is
Socrates. Since Plato never speaks in the dialogues, scholars face the question:
How much of what Plato puts into Socrates' mouth is Plato's own philosophy,
and how much is just a report of Socrates? Many scholars believe Plato's earlier
dialogues are historically accurate accounts of Socrates' teachings. Later, they
believe, Socates became a literary character for Plato's own purposes.
Plato is best known for his theory of forms-abstract, immaterial things imitated
by the physical objects of this world.
Another famous Platonic view is that all knowledge is recollection. Plato
believed the soul was immaterial and existed before it inhabited a body. Before it
was embodied, the soul knew the forms, without being distracted and limited by
sensory perception. When human beings come to know something, it is because
our souls recollect what they knew before they were embodied.
Furthermore, Plato divided the soul into three parts: the appetitive part (which
desires sensual pleasure like food, drink, and sex), the spirited part (which
desires glory and honor), and the rational part (which desires to understand the
forms). In the dialogue The Republic, Plato describes what it is for a soul to be
just, by drawing an extended analogy between ajust soul and a just city. Plato
describes the perfectly just city as having groups of citizens that correspond to
the three parts of the soul. He believed those groups must harmoniously interact
in the same way that the three parts of the soul should. In both cases, the soul
and the city, Plato believed that the rational should dominate.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Plato appears only in one of his dialogues, Apology, which describes the trial
of Socrates, at which he is sentenced to death. Plato says nothing in the
dialogue, but his inclusion indicates that he was present at the actual event.
2. Plato was the teacher ofAristotle (384-322 BC).
SUNDAY, DAY 7
Cain and Abel
Cain and Abel were the eldest sons of Adam and Eve, born after their expulsion
from the Garden of Eden. Cain, the elder, was the first human being to be born-
as opposed to being created-according to the Torah. Cain tilled the Earth while
Abel was a shepherd, herding lambs.
One day, God asked Cain and Abel to each make a sacrifice to him. It is said that
Abel thought very hard about what kind of sacrifice would make God happiest.
He decided to sacrifice one of his precious lambs. Cain, on the other hand,
thought only about what he needed least. He sacrificed some fruit and grain. God
clearly preferred Abel's sacrifice.
Cain quickly became jealous of his younger brother and murdered him. When
God came to look for Abel, he could not find him. He asked Cain where Abel
was. Cain replied, "I don't know. Am I my brother's keeper?" (Genesis 4:9)
After God realized what Cain had done, he punished him with a curse; he could
no longer farm and had to wander for the rest of his life. Cain worried he would
be harmed by people he met, so God placed a protective marking on him.
Besides the religious and moral lessons, the Cain and Abel story illustrates the
historical conflict between people who were using the sparse fertile land for
growing crops and those who were using it to raise livestock. A similar tale
appears in Sumerian culture about a beautiful goddess forced to choose between
two suitors: a farmer god and a shepherd god.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. The nature of the mark placed on Cain is not described. Some claim that it
was a mark on his face or red hair. Still others argue that it was black skin, a
theory later used to just fy slavery.
2. In some Muslim versions ofthe story, Abel is claimed to have offered no
resistance while his brother murdered him and is seen as a symbol ofpacifism.

WEEK 4

MONDAY, DAY I
Alexander the Great
Alexander the Great (356-323 BC) was born in Macedonia, a mountainous
kingdom in northern Greece, and educated by the famous Athenian teacher
Aristotle. His father, King Philip II, had expanded Macedonia's territory to
include most of the ancient city-states of Greece, including Athens. Alexander
inherited his father's crown at age twenty, following Philip's assassination at a
theater.
As king, Alexander surpassed his father by engineering an amazing string of
conquests, creating an empire that encompassed much of the Mediterranean
world at the time. No other king had dominated such a wide swath of the ancient
world. From his base in Macedonia, Alexander's armies conquered Greece,
Syria, Egypt, Mesopotamia, and the Persian Empire. In 330 BC, six years after
he became king, Alexander defeated Darius, the king of Persia. Alexander
eventually extended his kingdom as far as India. His reign ended abruptly when
he died in the ancient city of Babylon at age thirty-three.
The empire Alexander created was divided among his officers, but it continued
on for hundreds of years until it was conquered by the Romans. In the conquered
territories, Alexander and his troops had encountered new civilizations with
different customs. Rather than simply destroy the cultures of defeated nations,
the Greeks absorbed them. A new, hybrid culture known as Hellenism emerged.
For the first time in history, a large part of southeastern Europe and the Near
East spoke the same language and shared a cultural background. Greek remained
the lingua franca of the ancient world for centuries; the books of the New
Testament were originally written in Greek. The cultural ferment caused by the
arrival of Alexander's armies remains perhaps his most meaningful legacy to the
modern world.
Alexander remains of great interest today. Contemporary historians continue to
examine his ruthless command of the army, his love for horses, his study of
philosophy, and, more recently, they have questioned his sexual orientation.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. When Alexander was a child, he was unhappy with his father's conquests.
According to Plutarch, the young Alexander was sad that there would be less
left for him to conquer when he became king.
2. After conquering Egypt, Alexander founded the city ofAlexandria on the
Mediterranean coast, one of a dozen cities he named after himself In
Alexandria, the Greeks built a gigantic library to house thousands
ofparchments. The library burneddown a few centuries later, destroying avast
amount of knowledge about the ancient world.
3. Alexander was an avid hunter, who reportedly hunted 4, 000 animals,
including lions, during d single hunt in what is now known as Uzbekistan.
Ancient Greeks huntedgame with a spear, a net, and little else.
TUESDAY, DAY 2
Paradise Lost
John Milton's epic poem Paradise Lost (1667) is a vast, detailed rendition of
mankind's fall from innocence told in the Biblical book of Genesis. Considered
the finest epic poem in English, Milton's masterpiece is important not only as a
landmark in Western literature but also as an influential work of the Protestant
Reformation.
Paradise Lost is written in blank verse-unrhymed iambic pentameter, a structure
with five two-syllable feet per line. Shakespeare used blank verse in many of his
plays, but Milton significantly expanded its possibilities and applications. He
also made extensive use of the epic simile, a type of long, complex comparison
that Homer and other classical poets used frequently in their epics.
As Paradise Lost opens, Satan and the other fallen angels have just rebelled
against God and lost the war in heaven. As punishment, God has cast them into
hell. Desiring revenge, Satan and his followers decide to try to corrupt
humankind, God's most prized creation. Satan sneaks out of hell and enters
Eden. As Adam and Eve sleep, Satan disguises himself as a toad, whispers into
Eve's ear, and sows the seeds of discontent. Aware of Satan's plot, God sends the
angel Raphael to warn Adam. When Satan returns to Eden, he finds that Eve has
persuaded Adam to let her work alone. In the guise of a serpent, he convinces
her through flattery and cunning to disobey God and eat the fruit from the Tree
of Knowledge. Adam despairs upon learning of Eve's deed but makes a
conscious decision to eat the fruit as well, as he would rather join Eve in her
fallen condition than continue to live in Eden without her. After a visit from the
archangel Michael, who shows Adam a vision of the misfortunes that await
humankind, Adam and Eve leave Eden "hand in hand," shedding tears,
"wand'ring steps and slow."
Villains are often the most interesting characters in literary works, and Paradise
Lost is no exception. Satan is the most complex, fully realized, and fascinating
figure. He is an antihero, demonstrating vision, leadership, and eloquence but
directing those qualities toward proud, selfish ends. Moreover, he is not blindly
evil but rather very self-aware, tormented by the wretched knowledge that God
has banished him. Ultimately, Satan comes across as a tragic figurea theological
twist that prompted some of Milton's detractors to accuse him, literally, of too
much sympathy for the devil.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Milton went blind (possibl),from glaucoma) and by 1654 had to dictate his
writings to an assistar
2. Milton followed Paradise Lost with Paradise Regained (1671), which retells
the New Testament story of Jesus's confrontation with Satan during his forty
days in the wilderness.
WEDNESDAY, DAY 3
Venus de Milo
One of the most famous sculptures of all time, the Venus de Milo received its
name from the fact that it was discovered by a peasant on the Aegean island of
Melos in 1820. The work was seized by Turkish officials and eventually sold to
a French naval official. In 1821 it was presented to Louis XVIII, who donated it
to the Louvre Museum in Paris, where it can be seen today.
The statue, which is six and a half feet tall, is sculpted out of Parian marble. Its
subject is Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love and beauty, known to the
Romans as Venus. A sculpted arm holding an apple was found nearby. Many
scholars believe that the arm was originally attached. According to myth, Paris
of Troy had given Venus a golden apple to identify her as the most beautiful
woman in the world.
The artist and date of the sculpture have given rise to much debate. Initially
authorities at the Louvre declared it a classical (fifth- or fourth-century BC)
work, possibly executed by Phidias or Praxiteles. However, the base on which
the statue had been found identified the artist as Alexandros of Antioch of
Menander, a colony that was not founded until later, in the Hellenistic period.
Although museum officials eventually agreed that the sculpture was
Hellenistic, it is still exhibited as the work of an anonymous artist.
The Venus de Milo has been admired throughout the world ever since its
discovery. The British playwright Oscar Wilde recounted the story of a man who
ordered a plaster copy of the statue and then sued the railroad company when it
arrived from Paris without arms. What surprised Wilde even more was the fact
that the man won his case.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. The statue was claimed by Ludwig I of Bavaria, who insisted that it had been
found on territory that he had purchased in Melos in 1817.
2. In 1964, the statue was exhibited in japan, where more than 1.5 million people
viewed it from a moving sidewalk.
THURSDAY, DAY 4
The Greenhouse Effect
The phrase greenhouse effect can be used to describe two different scientific
phenomena. The first is the entirely natural process by which the atmosphere
prevents heat from escaping back into space. It is the mechanism by which the
average surface temperature on earth is maintained at a hospitable 60 degrees
Fahrenheit.
When energy from the sun reaches the planet's surface, some of it is absorbed,
warming the ground, and some of it is reflected into space. Water vapor, carbon
dioxide, methane, and other gases in the atmosphere-known collectively as the
greenhouse gases-trap some of the outgoing energy, like the glass panels of a
greenhouse. Without the greenhouse effect, the earth would be so cold that life
would be impossible.
The expression greenhouse effect also refers to an increase in greenhouse gases
over the last century that may be contributing to global warming. The earth's
surface temperature has risen one degree in the past hundred years, with a sharp
increase in the past two decades, according to the National Academy of
Sciences. The year 1998 was the hottest year on record. At the same time,
greenhouse gases, proven to retain heat, have increased dramatically. Carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere is up 30 percent since before the industrial revolution,
and the levels of methane have more than doubled.
Perhaps most important, there is more water in the atmosphere. As polar ice caps
have melted, the sea level has risen four to eight inches, increasing worldwide
rainfall by 1 percent. This may spark a vicious cycle. More water in the
atmosphere means more heat trapped at the surface. As the surface becomes
hotter, the ice caps will melt faster, leading to more water in the oceans and still
more water vapor in the atmosphere. Again, that will fuel the cycle, causing the
surface to become hotter and the ice caps to melt faster.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Scientists from the Environmental Protection Agency estimate that the global
surface temperature will rise I to 4.5 degrees Fahrenheit in the next fifty years
and the sea level will rise two feet along the US coastline.
2. Recent reports from NASA estimate that at present melting rates during
summers, the Arctic may be completely free of ice by the end of the century.
3. The carbon dioxide saturated atmosphere of Venus causes a runaway
greenhouse effect, a positive feedback cycle of reheating that leaves Venus's
surface hot enough to melt lead. Mars has almost no atmosphere, and hence no
greenhouse effect, which is part of the reason it is so cold.
4. The greenhouse effect was discovered in 1824 by Joseph Fourier.
FRIDAY, DAY 5
Medieval/Early Church Music
The first known written music comes from the Middle Ages. It takes the form
ofplainchant-also known as Gregorian Chant-sung melodies used by monks
during the Catholic Mass. The Mass is a ritual reenactment of Christ's Last
Supper, intended to provide a spiritual connection between man and God. Part of
this connection was established through music.
The Mass is divided into two sets of rituals: the ordinary and the proper. The
ordinary consists of six Latin prayers (Kyrie Eleison, Gloria in Excelsis, Credo,
Sanctus, Aguas Dei, and Ite missa est), which always contain the same text and
occur at every Mass. The prayers of the proper, which include the Introit,
Gradual, Offertory, and Communion, consist of texts that vary according to
seasonal liturgy and local traditions. Medieval musicians passed Gregorian
melodies along orally, creating new ones by combining melodic formulas.
Most medieval music is monophonic, consisting of a single melodic line. But
around the tenth century, some musicians began to write in a style called
organum-two parallel melody lines, usually a fourth or a fifth apart. Two
centuries later, Leonin and Perotin (music directors at the cathedral of Notre
Dame in Paris), composed organa with up to four independent, nonparallel
musical lines.
In the thirteenth century, a complex polyphonic form known as the motet
emerged. It was made up of a Latinate cantus firmus, or fixed melodic line, with
several other complementary parts sung in French, Latin, or both. Guillaume de
Machaut was an early master of the motet, and in the fourteenth century, he
would compose the first complete polyphonic setting of the Mass ordinary.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. During this period in southern France, aristocratic poets, called troubadours,
composed secular songs about love and war. Wandering musicians called
jongleurs would travel from one royal court to another, singing their own songs
and those of the troubadours. Today a musician who travels from town to town
is still sometimes referred to as a troubadour.
2. In the mid-1990s, the Benedictine Monks ofSanto Domingo de Silos released
a two-CD series called Chant that made plainchant popular (mostly to the new-
age audience) for the first time since the MiddleAges.
3. Hildegard von Bingen (1098-1179) was the earliest known female composer.
She was an abbess and a mystic, and she wrote many monophonic works for
the Catholic Church, almost all of them written for female voices. She also
wrote a Catholic mystery play called the Ordo virtutum. She has been beatified,
but notyet canonized, by the Catholic Church.
SATURDAY, DAY 6
Forms
Consider all the beautiful things in the world. Do they have anything in
common? What explains the fact that they are all beautiful? According to Plato
(429-347 BC) the answer to both these questions is that there is a form or idea
called beauty and each beautiful thing is beautiful because it has some relation to
that form. Plato believed that there are many forms that function in this way, not
just the form of beauty. There is a form of redness, that accounts for all red
things in the world; a form of the good that accounts for all the good in the
world; and so on.
Platonic forms, like beauty, are timeless and unchanging. Furthermore, the form
beauty is itself beautiful. It has no features other than being beautiful, and it is
beautiful in an unrestricted and unqualified way. Other beautiful things have
additional features like size and shape, and they are only beautiful to a limited
degree. Individual beautiful things are beautiful by virtue of participating in
beauty. Plato thought of participation as imperfect imitation. Thus, individual
beautiful things imitate beauty, but only up to a point.
For Plato, the forms are more real than the particular physical objects that imitate
them. Where the forms are timeless and unchanging, physical things are in flux,
constantly coming to be, and then going out of existence. Where the forms are
unqualified perfection, physical things are qualified and conditioned.
Plato believed that long before our bodies ever existed, our souls existed and
inhabited heaven, where they became directly acquainted with the forms
themselves. Real knowledge is knowledge of the forms. But knowledge of the
forms cannot be attained through sensory experience, because the forms, after
all, are not in the physical world. Therefore, our knowledge of the forms, our
real knowledge, must be the recollection of our initial acquaintance with the
forms in heaven. Therefore, what appears to us as learning is in fact merely
remembering.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Plato firstpresented his theory offorms in his dialogue Phaedo, which
describes the last hours ofhis teacher Socrates. The theory is spoken by
Socrates himself, but many scholars think that it expresses Plato's view, not
Socrates's.
2. In the dialogue Meno, Socrates argues for the recollection theory of learning
by showing that a young slave with no education can understanda
proofofEuclid.
SUNDAY, DAY 7
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
Abraham is considered the patriarch of monotheism. His sons Isaac (with Sarah)
and Ishmael (with Hagar) and their descendants are credited with the founding of
Judaism and Islam, respectively.
When Abraham was a young man-then called Abram-living in Ur, God appeared
and instructed him to travel to the land of Canaan. Late in life, Abram grew
concerned that he had no children. His wife, Sarai-then called Sarah-appeared to
be barren so she allowed him to sleep with her maidservant Hagar. Hagar
subsequently gave birth to Abram's first son, Ishmael. Out of anger and jealousy,
Sarai had Abram banish Hagar and Ishmael.
God then made a covenant with Abram. In exchange for Abram's service and
devotion, God would grant him a son with Sarai, who would give rise to a great
and numerous people. The land of Canaan would be theirs. As a sign of this
covenant, at the age of ninety-nine, Abram changed his name to Abraham and
Sarai to Sarah. Abraham was circumcised and promised his future sons would be
as well.
Sarah gave birth to Isaac, who fulfilled the promise that Abraham made with
God. When Isaac was a young man, God told Abraham to sacrifice him as an
offering. Abraham, in his absolute devotion, agreed to do so. However, just
before he was about to kill his own son, an angel stopped him. In the Torah, this
is seen as one of the great examples of faith.
Isaac married Rebekah and had twins. The second-born, whom Rebekah
favored, was Jacob, later called Israel. Jacob had twelve sons who went on to
found the twelve tribes of Israel and thus the people known as Israelites. With
his first wife, Leah, Jacob had Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and
Zebulun. With a handmaiden of Leah, he had Gad and Asher. With his favorite
wife, Rachel, he had Joseph (who was his favorite son) and Benjamin. And with
a handmaiden of Rachel he had Dan and Naphtali.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. According to Islam, the Muslim people are descendents oflshmael. Because
Ishmael was actually Abraham's first-born son, Muslims claim to be the true
heirs to the covenant with God. They believe thatAbraham was an important
prophet and that it was actually Ishmael whom he nearly sacrificed.
2. In Christian belief parallels are drawn between Abraham's readiness to
sacrifice Isaac and the sacrifice of God's own son, Jesus Christ.

WEEK 5

MONDAY, DAY I
Julius Caesar
Julius Caesar (100-44 BC) was a Roman general who rose to prominence in the
first century BC conquering what is now France, Belgium, and western
Germany. The Roman Senate, led by Pompey, was threatened by Caesar's
growing popularity and ordered him to disband his army. Caesar refused. He
marched his legions on the Capitol, crossing the Rubicon River-the decisive
moment from which he could not turn back-and started a civil war. He chased
his enemies across Europe and ultimately to Egypt where Pompey was killed.
Before leaving Egypt, Caesar fell in love with Cleopatra and installed her as
queen. When Caesar returned to Rome, he ruled as dictator. Caesar was
assassinated on the Ides (the fifteenth day) of March in 44 BC by a conspiracy
that included his best friend, Brutus.
Innumerable legends surround Caesar. When he was still in his twenties, he
was captured by pirates in the eastern Mediterranean. After being ransomed by
his men, he raised a small army from the local leaders, located the pirates, and
crucified them all.
Years later, in 62 BC, when Caesar was climbing through Rome's political ranks,
a scandal erupted. A patrician named Publius Clodius was discovered at a
religious ritual where men were prohibited. The ritual was held in Caesar's
house, and a rumor soon spread that Clodius was there because he was having an
affair with Caesar's wife, Pompeia. Caesar knew the rumors weren't true and said
so. Nevertheless he divorced her, noting that Caesar's wife and family must be
above suspicion.
Caesar was declared dictator by the Senate in the midst of his civil war against
Pompey. It was a time of crisis, and the leader was thought to require decisive,
emergency powers. But the emergency never passed. The Republic was not to be
restored.
Caesar ruled as dictator, but he was largely careful to maintain the appearance of
consulting the Senate-stacked with his supporters-and respecting the Republic's
traditions. However, in the final years of his life, he grew careless, allowing his
Asian subjects to worship him as a god, and coins with his image were minted,
the first time a living Roman was so honored. They bore the inscription,
"Perpetual Dictator." These gratuitous honors are thought to have fueled the
resentment that culminated in his overthrow and murder.
ADDITIONAL FACT
1. After a successful military campaign in Asia, Caesar famously declared,
"Vent, vidi, vinci."(I came, I saw, I conquered.)
TUESDAY, DAY 2
Homer
The stories told in Homer's Iliad and Odyssey have been so long embedded in
Western culture that they are inescapable even to this day. From the Trojan
Horse to the Cyclops, from Achilles' heel to the Sirens' song, elements of both
epics remain mainstays of our literature and everyday language nearly 3,000
years after they were written.
The Iliad and Odyssey are epic poems-lengthy verse works in Greek that were
likely read or sung aloud and passed down orally for generations before they
were committed to writing. Homer's exact role in this process remains a
mystery, and there is debate over whether he actually existed at all. In any case,
scholars believe that both works were composed in or around the eighth
century BC in Ionia, an area of ancient Greece that is now part of the
Mediterranean coast of Turkey.
The Iliad tells of the exploits of Achilles, Agamemnon, Hector, and other
heroes during the Trojan War between Achaea (Greece) and Troy. According to
myth, the war began when the Trojan prince Paris kidnapped Helen of Sparta,
the most beautiful woman in the world, and took her back to Troy to be his wife.
The Iliad begins nine years into the conflict, focusing on the rage of the Achaean
warrior Achilles and exploring the combination of greatness and fatal flaws that
the hero displays. Along the way, Homer incorporates the evocative imagery-
"rosy-fingered Dawn," the "wine-dark sea"-for which the poem is justly
renowned.
The Iliad's sequel, the Odyssey, recounts the trials of the Greek hero Odysseus as
he attempts to sail home from the Trojan War to rejoin his wife, Penelope. The
journey takes ten years to complete, largely because Odysseus angers the sea
god, Poseidon, who does everything in his power to hinder Odysseus's voyage.
Using his own cleverness and help from the goddess Athena, Odysseus
eventually returns home to Ithaca and dispatches the numerous suitors who have
advanced on his still-faithful wife.
Regardless of the specifics of their authorship, the Iliad and Odyssey had an
enormous cultural and practical impact on everyday life in ancient Greece. It
was common to memorize the epics from start to finish. Though Greece's golden
age waned in the 100s BC, Homer's works endured, inspiring the epics of
ancient Rome, such as Virgil's Aeneid.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Though the Trojan War was long believed to be merely legend, archaeological
discoveries in Turkey in the late 1800s suggested that it may have had some
historical basis.
2. The famous phrase describing Helen of Troy as the "face that launch'd a
thousand ships"appears not in the Iliad but in Christopher Marlowe'splay Dr.
Faustus (1604).
WEDNESDAY, DAY 3
Hagia Sophia
The Hagia Sophia was built in Constantinople (present-day Istanbul) under the
personal supervision of the Emperor Justinian. At the church's dedication, the
Byzantine ruler purportedly claimed that he had surpassed Solomon, the Old
Testament king responsible for the famous temple in Jerusalem.
It is often said that the Hagia Sophia unites the mysticism of the East with the
ambitious scale of Roman imperial architecture, such as the Pantheon.
Isidore of Miletus and Anthemius of Tralles, mathematicians rather than
architects, designed the masterpiece, which was built between 532 and 537. The
dome of the church rises 180 feet and is supported by four pendentives or
triangular sections that distribute the hemisphere's weight evenly on four piers.
Forty windows at the dome's base allow light to flow in, making it seem
weightless, as if floating above the worshippers below. At first, the church was
decorated with gold mosaics and decorative patterns. Subsequent emperors
added many images of holy figures.
Over the years, Hagia Sophia, which means "church of the holy wisdom" in
Greek, has suffered considerable damage from earthquakes. Originally the
Byzantine emperor's personal church, it was converted to a mosque after the
capture of Constantinople by Ottoman Turks in 1453. Since images of the human
form are prohibited by Islam, the figurative mosaics were plastered over. Four
minarets (towers from which the faithful are called to worship) were added,
along with Arabic calligraphy that can still be seen in the building today. In
1936, under the Turkish ruler Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the building was
secularized and converted into the Ayasofia Museum, one of the chief tourist
attractions of modern Istanbul.
In 1993 UNESCO placed the Hagia Sophia on a list of the world's most
endangered historic sites. Since then, the building's foundation has been
reinforced and many more of the old mosaics have been uncovered.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. In the mid-sixth century, the Hagia Sophia was thoroughly described by
Procopius in a Byzantine treatise entitled On Architecture.
2. Porphyry columns initially taken by the Romans from an Egyptian temple in
Heliopolis were brought to Constantinople and used in the construction of the
Hagia Sophia.
3. The church was sacked during the Fourth Crusade in 1204.
THURSDAY, DAY 4
Black Holes
A black hole can result when a massive star dies out. The dying star collapses
into itself, becoming smaller and smaller, denser and denser, until it compresses
into a single point with no radius and infinite density. The point, called a
singularity, is so dense that nearby light cannot escape its gravitational pull.
Everything close to the star gets sucked into blackness.
When a rocket launches into space, it needs to travel fast enough to escape the
gravitational pull of the Earth. If it fails to reach the appropriate escape speed,
then it simply falls back down. The gravitational pull of a black hole is so strong,
the escape speed is faster than the speed of light. Therefore, nothing can escape
because nothing can travel faster than light. The boundary surrounding the
singularity where the escape speed equals the speed of light is called the event
horizon. Anything that falls inside the event horizon gets sucked into the
singularity.
Of course, all of this is theoretical. We can't actually see black holes because
they don't give off any light. We know of their existence only because other
objects in space interact with their mass. A large number of stars orbiting around
a black center indicates there might be a black hole in the middle. Also, black
holes are so dense that they can bend light. As a result, scientists on Earth
sometimes will see multiple images of the same star. When they do, they infer
that somewhere between us and the star is a black hole.
Black holes pose a dilemma for physicists. They seem to defy the law of
quantum mechanics that states that energy cannot be created or destroyed. The
light sucked into the center of a black hole seems to be destroyed, as it is crushed
into an infinitely small space. But if thelight is somehow conserved, then can it
escape someday? Is it possible for a black hole to reverse itself? These are
unanswered questions of astrophysics.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. There is no reason to believe that black holes will suck up all the energy in the
universe. They pull in only objects that cross the event horizon.
2. Albert Einstein, rejecting the principlesofquantummechanics,oncesaid "God
does not play dice with the universe. " Stephen Hawking, referring to black
holes, once said, "God not only plays dice. He sometimes throws them where
they cannot be seen."
3. If you were to cross the event horizon of a black hole, to an outside observer it
would look like you were moving slower and slower but never quite reaching
the horizon. The illusion is caused by the black hole's immense gravity. Itpulls
on the lightyou emit, which means that light takes longer and longer to reach
the outside observer. But from your point of view, you cross the event horizon
and nothing special occurs until you are crushed to death at the singularity.
FRIDAY, DAY 5
Instruments and Ensembles
The combined sound of a particular assortment of musical instruments, more
than any other technical aspect of music, is what makes much Western art music,
or classical music, so distinct. The sonic color, or timbre, of a string quartet or an
orchestra is a big part of what separates this type of music from contemporary
rock or pop.
Not including the human voice, there are five categories of musical instruments:
strings (plucked or played with a bow), winds (played by blowing air through a
mouthpiece, a hole, or a reed), percussion (usually struck with drumsticks or
mallets), keyboards, and in the twentieth century, electronic instruments.
By about 1750, the baroque orchestra had been established: a wind section
including flutes, oboes, bassoons, horns, and trumpets; timpani (kettle drums);
continuo (often a combination of a keyboard instrument playing chords, with the
bass line reinforced by a cello); and a string section. The violin was the
dominant voice of the baroque period's complex melodic lines. Predated by the
medieval fiddle, it emerged in its current form during the first half of the
sixteenth century in northern Italy.
With the advent of the classical period, the winds were increasingly used to
round out the harmonic textures of the orchestra. The larger symphonies of Franz
Joseph Haydn and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart are generally written for two of
each of the woodwind and brass instruments, plus timpani and strings.
By the mid-nineteenth century, composers such as Hector Berlioz were writing
for larger orchestras that included harps, as well as newer instruments like the
English horn, alto clarinet, and various percussion instruments.
By the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Richard Wagner, Gustav
Mahler, and Arnold Schoenberg were writing pieces for very large orchestras,
sometimes with a hundred musicians. Later composers introduced instruments
from popular music and jazz, such as the saxophone, synthesizers, and other
electronic devices.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. In early music, composers wrote whole pieces without specifying which
instruments were to play them. It wasn't until Monteverdi's 1607 opera Orfeo
that a musical score came with suggestions as to which instrument should play
which written part.
2. The name piano comes from `pianoforte" because itplays both piano (soft) and
forte (loud) music. It was developed by harpsichord maker Bartolomeo
Cristofori around 1700 in northern Italy.
SATURDAY, DAY 6
Plato's Cave Allegory
"See human beings as though they were in an underground cave-like dwelling
with its entrance, a long one, open to the light across the whole width of the
cave. They are in it from childhood with their legs and necks in bonds so that
they are fixed, seeing only in front of them, unable because of the bond to turn
their heads all the way around. . ."
-Plato, The Republic
In his writings, Plato uses the character of Socrates, his real-life teacher, to
espouse his own philosophical views. The Republic is written in the form of a
dialogue between Socrates and his students.
In this famous passage from The Republic, Socrates describes a scenario in
which men, trapped in a cave, can see only the shadows of objects projected on
the wall. They are forced to face forward while a fire burns behind them. Objects
are held up in front of the fire, projecting images the men identify. For instance,
the men in the cave may think they see a book, but what they see is only the
book's shadow as it is held up behind them.
When a man escapes the cave to witness the true nature of things, he is at first
pained by the brilliance of the sun and confused by the physical objects. But
when he eventually understands the true nature of the world, he pities the masses
who know only shadows. Of course, the men in Socrates' cave resist learning the
truth and think their escaped friend is crazy when he tries to describe it.
In the allegory, the men trapped in the cave represent the world's ignorant
masses. They see only representations of objects, the sights and sounds that can
be discerned by our physical senses. The man who escapes the cave to witness
the true nature of things is the philosopher. Using their intellect, philosophers
are able to discern formsabstract, immutable truths that are the real foundation
of the universe. The philosopher who escapes the cave knows the real nature of
things.
The Republic is ultimately concerned with the question of justice. Plato
believed that in order to establish justice, one must know what is good.
Therefore, philosophers who understood the form of the good should rule as
kings. The rest of society should be organized to fulfill those rulers' demands.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Plato was born in Athens in 428 BC.
2. Plato referred to his philosopher kings as "Guardians."
SUNDAY, DAY 7
Sarah
Sarah was the wife of Abraham and the matriarch of the Jewish people.
Sarah was so beautiful that when she and Abraham fled to Egypt during a
famine, her beauty caused Abraham to fear for their safety. Concerned that
Pharaoh would kill him and take Sarah for himself, Abraham pretended that he
and Sarah were siblings. Pharaoh did take Sarah, but spared Abraham and gave
him many gifts in return. God then punished Pharaoh, allowing Sarah and
Abraham to escape Egypt together.
Although she was beautiful, Sarah was barren for the majority of her life and
could not bear Abraham's child. Thus, as was the custom, she gave her
handmaiden, Hagar, to Abraham so that he could continue his lineage. Hagar
then gave birth to Abraham's first son, Ishmael.
After the birth, Sarah's relationship with Hagar was strained. Hagar no longer
respected Sarah, and Sarah became jealous. Finally, Sarah asked Abraham to
banish Hagar and her son. According to Jewish tradition, Sarah had more
prophetic insight than Abraham, and so Abraham deferred to her wishes.
When Sarah was ninety years old, God told Abraham that she would finally bear
his child, causing Abraham to laugh. God insisted, and when Sarah overheard
she laughed as well. But Sarah felt ashamed for doubting God and affirmed her
faith. One year later, she gave birth to Isaac whose line would become the twelve
tribes of Israel.
Nearly forty years later, Sarah died in Hebron, at the age of 127. According to
some writings, Sarah's death was related to Abraham's near sacrifice of Isaac. In
one story Satan told Sarah that Abraham had killed Isaac. When she discovered
that Isaac had actually survived, she died of joy.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Sarah is buried with her husband, Abraham, in the Cave of the Patriarchs in
Hebron. Their son Isaac and his wife, their grandson Jacob, and his first wife,
Leah, are buried there as well.
2. The only one of Judaism's patriarchs and matriarchs not buried in Hebron is
Jacob's second wife, Rachel, who is buried in Bethlehem.

WEEK 6

MONDAY, DAY I
Rosetta Stone
In 1799, French soldiers in Napoleon's army discovered a mysterious black rock
buried in the sands near the city ofAlexandria, Egypt. The stone was inscribed in
three ancient languages. The rock's first inscription was in Greek. Scholars
determined it dated from about 196 BC, when Egypt was a province of the
Greek empire created by Alexander the Great. The other two inscriptions on the
black rock were in different versions of hieroglyphics, the traditional writing of
the Egyptians.
For thousands of years, Egypt was one of the great empires of the ancient
world. Ruled by kings known as pharaohs, the Egyptians built gigantic
monuments such as the Great Pyramids and the Sphinx. Egyptian armies
controlled lands from present-day Sudan to Syria. The pharaohs built thriving
cities and splendid tombs for themselves.
But for centuries before the discovery of the Rosetta Stone, historians and
archeologists were unable to read the vast number of written records left by
Egypt's scribes. They wrote in a complicated script that was incomprehensible
to even the most learned modern scholars.
The Rosetta Stone, which recorded an edict issued by the Greek authorities to
the Egyptian population, unlocked the secrets of ancient Egypt. By lining up the
Greek text with the hieroglyphics, a French scholar named Jean-Francois
Champollion was able to decode the complex Egyptian language after years of
study. Deciphering hieroglyphics allowed historians and archeologists in the
nineteenth century to develop a much fuller understanding of ancient Egypt.
Translating the Rosetta Stone was a scholarly accomplishment in its own right.
Champollion was a prodigious linguist who was fluent in dozens of languages. A
British scholar, Thomas Young, also helped decode the inscriptions. The Rosetta
Stone was seized by the British in 1801 and now resides in the British Museum
in London.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. During World War I, the Rosetta Stone and other important exhibitions were
moved from the British Museum to a subway station to protect them from the
bombing ofLondon.
2. The text on the Rosetta Stone outlined the good deeds of the thirteen-year-old
Greek pharaoh, Ptolemy V, in an effort to convince his Egyptian subjects ofhis
divinity.
3. Ancient Egyptians believed that bodies should be preserved after death and
carefully embalmed the corpses oftheir kings in d process known as
mummification. As late as the nineteenth century, charlatans in Europe sold
mummies ground up into a powder, claiming it had medicinal value.
TUESDAY, DAY 2
Heart of Darkness
Joseph Conrad's 1899 novella Heart of Darkness was a work far ahead of its
time, in many ways the first truly twentieth-century novel. Though rooted in the
realistic style of the late nineteenth century, it addressed numerous themes that
would typify the modernist era that followed. It is also notable as one of the first
literary works to look critically at the rampant abuses that European imperialism
had wreaked in Africa and Asia during the 1800s.
Heart of Darkness is concise, only about eighty pages long. It is told in flashback
by a man named Marlow, who has taken a job with a Belgian colonial trading
business called only "the Company." He is sent to the Belgian Congo to captain a
steamboat up the Congo River to the Company's remote Inner Station, which is
run by an ivory trader named Kurtz. Upon arriving in Africa, Marlow is struck
by the decaying Company facilities and the racist Europeans' unabashed
exploitation of native Africans.
Conrad's Congo is a shadowy, intensely atmospheric world in which virtually
every character remains ominously nameless-the Manager, the Accountant, and
so on-and the jungle looms massive and impenetrable just beyond the edge of
each isolated Belgian settlement. As Marlow makes his way up the river into
increasingly remote territory, his journey becomes as much psychological as
physical. The trappings of civilization fall further away at each outpost, and he
begins to see himself as traveling into the primal, unknown reaches of the human
mind itself. Meanwhile, as Marlow learns more about the enigmatic Kurtz, it
becomes evident that Kurtz's intent to civilize the African natives has gone awry.
He has succumbed to his own fascination with the darkness and savagery of
Africa.
Heart of Darkness is particularly familiar today because of its unorthodox but
spectacular film adaptation, Apocalypse Now (1979). The film resets the novel
in 1970s Vietnam, with Marlon Brando in the Kurtz role as a US Army colonel
gone dangerously insane in a remote part of Cambodia. The screenplay preserves
many elements of Conrad's story while updating it with hallucinatory music and
visuals influenced by the 1960s counterculture.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. All of Conrad's major works are in English, despite the fact that he was
ofPolish descent (his birth name was Jkzef Teodor Konrad Korzeniowski), and
English was his third language.
2. Conrad's exploration of the human unconscious in Heart of Darkness mirrors
some of the ideas set forth by his contemporary, Sigmund Freud. To this day,
critics often analyze the novel from a Freudian viewpoint.
3. T. S. Eliot reused one of the book's famous lines, Mistah Kurtz-he dead,"as the
epigraph to his poem "The Hollow Men" (1925).
WEDNESDAY, DAY 3
Byzantine Art
The Byzantine Empire takes its name from the city of Byzantium, renamed
Constantinople in the fourth century by the Emperor Constantine, who moved
his court there from Rome. Today the city is known as Istanbul. After the decline
of the Roman Empire in the west, the eastern half continued to be run by the
Byzantine emperor in Constantinople.
The reign of Justinian (527-565) is known in art history as the First Golden Age
of Byzantium. It witnessed the creation of such works as the Hagia Sophia in
Constantinople and the church of San Vitale in Ravenna, Italy. A Second Golden
Age, from the late ninth to the eleventh century, produced Saint Mark's
Cathedral in Venice. Along with the Orthodox Faith, the Byzantine style spread
to Russia and eastern Europe, eventually inspiring the spectacular Cathedral of
Saint Basil in Moscow.
The subject of most Byzantine art is religious. Biblical narratives and idealized
representations or icons of holy figures predominate. The goal was less to
represent the actual likeness of Christ, the Virgin Mary, or some saint than to
capture his or her spiritual essence. Nude figures and life-sized sculpture, so
prevalent in Greco-Roman culture, were generally shunned.
Byzantine architecture is typified by the use of domes resting on pendentives.
The internal walls of churches are often richly decorated with marble panels,
patterns sculpted in low relief, and glass mosaics.
Traces of classical art surface occasionally. Although sculpture is rare in
Byzantine art, small ivory carvings depicting mythological scenes exist, such as
the famous Veroli Cabinet, with its panel of the Sacrifice of Iphigenia, based on
Euripides' play Iphigenia in Aulis.
In Byzantium, religious images were worshipped with such passion that in 726
the Emperor placed a ban on icons, claiming that they led to idolatry. For nearly
a century all images of Christ and Mary in human form were prohibited. The so-
called iconoclasts (image-destroyers) obliterated such images wherever they
could find them. Assisted by the support of the pope in Rome, the opposition
party, the so-called iconophiles, had the ban repealed in 843.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. The term byzantine often carries negative connotations, referring to something
that is either scheming or devious-as were many of the Byzantine rulers-or
excessively complex and intricate-as was their art.
2. The Byzantine style came to an end with the fall of Constantinople 1453.
Nevertheless its influence continues to manifest itself in the Orthodox Church,
where traditional icons are produced to this day.
THURSDAY, DAY 4
Supernova
Most stars die quietly, using up all their fuel through nuclear fusion. Then 99
percent fade away into dull celestial objects called white dwarves. But if a star is
big enough and hot enough, it can, under the right conditions, explode. The
explosion is called a supernova.
Before a star explodes, it fuses elements, producing energy. Its massive gravity
leads to the formation of oxygen, silicon, phosphorus, and calcium, making all
the heavy elements until it reaches iron, a cosmic dead end. Fusing iron into
even heavier elements does not produce energy but requires energy. The star has
nothing to burn, so its iron core continues to collapse into itself under the force
of its own gravity. The most massive stars collapse into black holes. But slightly
smaller stars, with masses five to eight times the size of our sun, simply explode.
A supernova takes less than fifteen seconds to complete. The explosion is so
bright that a supernova from a single star can outshine an entire galaxy for
months. It generates enough heat to create even heavier elements: mercury, gold,
and silver.
According to the big bang theory, life on earth exists because of supernovae. The
theory holds that all the elements heavier than oxygen were created in the past
explosions of giant stars. The potassium in your banana did not have its
beginnings on an island in the Caribbean. It may have been created a long time
ago in a supernova.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. In 1006, an extremely bright supernova was observed in Egypt, Iraq, Italy,
Switzerland, China, japan, and possibly France and Syria.
2. Galileo Galilei used a supernova in 1604 to disprove Aristotle's theory that the
universe never changes.
3. Even radioactive elements, such as uranium, are formed in supernovae.
FRIDAY, DAY 5
Renaissance Music
Renaissance music was produced from the middle of the fifteenth century to
about the end of the sixteenth-a period that saw the rise of Martin Luther, the
Protestant Reformation, and the Catholic Counter-Reformation. It is
characterized by several intermingling florid vocal or instrumental parts, all of
relatively equal importance.
The music of this time shared the aesthetic of the period's art and literature.
Renaissance artists, writers, and musicians saw themselves as pulling the world
out of the dark, clerical, mystical world of the Middle Ages. They emphasized a
return to the ideals of classical Greece and Rome: love, pleasure, intellect, and
the beauty of the human body and emotion.
The Franco-Flemish region in particular flourished with composers.
Guillaume Dufay (1400-1474), and Gilles Binchois (c.1400-1460) wrote some
of the earliest polyphonic masses and secular songs in the new style. Binchois'
pupil Johannes Ockeghem, court composer to the Duke of Bourbon, wrote
motets featuring some of the earliest instances of canon-singing. Canon is a
staggered imitation, as in the children's song "Row, Row, Row, Your Boat."
Josquin Desprez (c.1440-1521) was considered the greatest composer of the era,
renowned for his highly emotional mass settings and sophisticated secular
chansons, or love songs. In Italy, Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina (1525-1594)
was an itinerant court composer who imitated and elaborated upon the mass
settings of his predecessors and made the stylistic bridge between the
Renaissance and the Baroque periods.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. The idea ofa church hymn began in the Renaissance, and many of them were
composed by Martin Luther.
2. Most Renaissance music was composed for the courts, and some pieces are
only identifiable by the seal ofthe nobleman who solicited them, rather than the
composer's own signature.
3. The English madrigal song form was the first type ofsong to feature refrains
of ` fa-la-la"actually written in the music.
SATURDAY, DAY 6
Aristotle
"All men by nature desire to know."
-Aristotle, Metaphysics
The influence of Aristotle (384-322 BC) on philosophy and Western culture
generally would be hard to exaggerate. Born in Macedonia, north of Greece, in
384 BC, Aristotle traveled to Athens where he studied at Plato's school, the
Academy. After Plato's death, Aristotle founded his own school, the Lyceum.
In fifth-century Athens, the study of philosophy included rhetoric, natural
science, biology, and other fields of inquiry. Consequently, Aristotle made
major contributions to almost every branch of human learning.
Aristotle believed philosophy should be studied in a precise order. First, one
should learn logic, because logic explains how facts about the world relate to one
another. Aristotle developed the theory of syllogisms-arguments that are
logically valid. He devised a list of basic syllogisms and rules for reducing more
complicated arguments to one of those forms. The most famous Aristotelian
syllogism is:
After logic, Aristotle believed students should investigate concrete natural
phenomena. He wrote many works on the subject-Physics, Parts ofAnimals,
Generation ofAnimals, Motions of Animals, Meterology, On Generation and
Corruption-and deduced several general principles to explain the physical world.
The final subject for study, according to Aristotle, is practical philosophy, which
includes ethics and politics. He treated these topics, respectively, in
Nichomachean Ethics and Politics. In Aristotle's conception, ethics is mostly a
matter of good training. He believes that people usually know the proper way to
behave, and they must simply be morally strong enough to behave in accordance
with this knowledge. Being a good person amounts to having the inclination to
do the right thing, and this inclination can be bred into us. Politically, Aristotle
believed that the goal of the state is to provide the context for the happy and self-
sufficient lives of its citizens. He was partial to democratic government, but he
acknowledged that occasionally a monarchy is more appropriate.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Aristotle is sometimes referred to as the Stagirite,"because he was born in the
Macedonian city Stagira.
2. Between his time at Plato's Academy and the founding of his own school,
Aristotle was tutor to Alexander the Great, also a Macedonian, who ruled
much of the Mediterranean world.
SUNDAY, DAY 7
Sodom and Gomorrah
The story of Sodom and Gomorrah appears in Chapter 19 of the Book of
Genesis. Sodom and Gomorrah were two towns in the Jordan river valley. The
inhabitants of these towns had sinned, and God wished to destroy them.
Abraham protested that the innocent should not be killed with the wicked, and
God agreed to spare the towns if Abraham could find ten worthy men. He sent a
group of angels to investigate.
When the angels arrived, they came upon Lot, a nephew of Abraham. Lot invited
the angels into his home and prepared a meal for them. Later, the citizens of
Sodom appeared at Lot's house and demanded, "Where are the men that came in
to thee this night? Bring them out unto us, that we may know them." (Genesis
19:5) Instead, Lot offered his virgin daughters to the men of Sodom, but they
were not satisfied. At this point, seeing that the situation was dire, the angels told
Lot to get himself and his family out of Sodom. The angels instructed Lot and
his family not to look back as they fled. Lot was able to escape to a nearby town,
but as Sodom and Gomorrah were being destroyed, his wife glanced back and
was turned into a pillar of salt.
It is unclear what sins were actually committed by the citizens of Sodom and
Gomorrah. Traditionally, Jews believe that they committed the sin of
inhospitality. The story occurs just after the Torah tells how much God
appreciated Abraham's hospitality. Abraham's good behavior can be starkly
contrasted with how the citizens of Sodom reacted to their visitors. Taken
together, these two stories seem to emphasize the importance of being a good
host.
Conservative Christians, on the other hand, see the sins of Sodom quite
differently. When the citizens of Sodom demanded to "know" the angels, it is
believed by some that this "knowing" was really a euphemism for sex.
According to this view, the men of Sodom were homosexuals, and God punished
them for their sexual orientation.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. The contemporary term sodomy is derived from the Biblical town ofSodom.
2. The actual existence of Sodom and Gomorrah is disputed, but some believe
they may lie under the Dead Sea. Historians think the towns may have been
near a fault line and that God's wrath was actually a terrible earthquake that
flattened them.

WEEK 7

MONDAY, DAY I
Emperor Constantine
In the early years of Christianity, this small sect faced ruthless persecution
throughout the giant Roman Empire. In 64 AD, only a few decades after Christ's
death in Jerusalem, Emperor Nero ordered the first official persecution of
Christians in Rome. The Roman historian Tacitus recounted the particular
cruelty of the executions ordered by the deranged tyrant Nero, some of which
involved feeding believers to dogs. "In their very deaths they were made the
subjects of sport," Tacitus wrote.
Roman authorities considered Christianity a threat to the empire's security. As
they viewed it, Christians worshipped a criminal crucified by Rome and
rejected the divinity of the emperor and the pagan gods. As the religion spread,
the persecutions intensified sporadically for 200 years. Nevertheless, while the
first Christians were often poor, the religion began to attract adherents from the
mainstream of Roman life.
After seeing a vision and converting to Christianity, Emperor Constantine issued
the Edict of Milan in 313 AD, legalizing Christianity throughout the empire. By
that time, Christian worship was widespread. In fact, within a few generations of
the edict, Christianity replaced paganism as the official creed of the Roman
Empire. In the span of four centuries, Christianity had gone from an outlaw faith
embraced by a few Jewish malcontents to an imperial religion. The Roman
Empire collapsed in the fifth century AD, but Christianity continued to spread in
Europe and became the unifying faith of the continent.
The Roman Catholic Church remains headquartered at Vatican City in Rome, a
few blocks from the ruins of the colosseum where ancient Roman authorities
once fed Christians to the lions.
ADDITIONAL FACTS:
1. Constantine's conversion to Christianity didn't prevent bin from killing off
many of his political enemies, including several members of his own family.
During his thirty-one year reign, Constantine executed his brother-in-law, his
second wife, and his eldest son.
2. Sick of Rome, which he considered an unsuitable capital for his empire,
Constantine founded a city at the Hellespont, where Europe meets Asia. It was
originally named New Rome, but soon came to be known as Constantinople in
honor of the emperor. The city is now known as Istanbul, the largest city in
modern-day Turkey.
3. As emperor, Constantine abolished the gladiatorial games that had amused the
Roman masses for centuries, although they continued illegally for decades.
TUESDAY, DAY 2
Modernism
In the modernist movement in literature, which flourished from roughly 1900 to
1940, authors explored new ways to tell stories and rethought the question of
how best to explore objective reality and truth. Major figures in literary
modernism included the novelists Marcel Proust, Gertrude Stein, James Joyce,
Virginia Woolf, and William Faulkner, and the poets T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound.
During the late 1800s, Western literature had been dominated by realism.
Gustave Flaubert, Theodore Dreiser, Emile Zola, and other novelists of that
period had attempted to depict characters, situations, and social conditions
accurately and with a meticulous eye for detail.
Around the turn of the twentieth century, however, revolutionary ideas in a
number of fields called into question our ability to identify and describe reality-
and even the existence of an objective reality in the first place. In psychology,
Sigmund Freud explored the idea of the unconscious, asserting that the human
mind and the self were knowable only through psychoanalysis. In linguistics,
Ferdinand de Saussure contended that language was an arbitrary and unreliable
cultural construct. In anthropology, Sir James Frazer brought new sophistication
to the study of non-Western cultures and religions, exposing alternatives to the
Western worldview. And in physics, Albert Einstein's theories of relativity
undermined even the seemingly certain principles of space and time.
Collectively, these disparate ideas exerted enormous influence on the literary and
artistic worlds. Whereas the realists of the 1800s had been obsessed with
portraying the world accurately, new authors and artists of the 1900s-soon
dubbed modernists-became preoccupied with the question of how reality could
be accurately rendered if objective truth did not exist.
Modernist writers tackled this problem through experimentation. One of their
major innovations was stream-of-consciousness narrative, the attempt to convey
a character's inner thoughts verbatim, without authorial interference. This
technique appears in Joyce's Ulysses (1922), Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway (1925), and
Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury (1929). Some authors tried to depict the same
event or image from multiple perspectives, stacking subjective accounts on top
of one another-or pitting them against one another-in an attempt to approximate
objective truth. Woolf's To the Lighthouse (1927) is a prime example of this
approach. Still others, notably Stein, experimented radically with language,
using extensive repetition, which she called "insistence," and other techniques to
explore shades of words' meaning. And virtually all modernists played with the
flow of time in their works, discarding linear chronology and jumping abruptly
around past, present, and futurea characteristic that gives modernist fiction and
poetry an often-deserved reputation for difficulty.
WEDNESDAY, DAY 3
Gothic Art
The Gothic era began in the twelfth century with the development of a new type
of architecture in the He de France, an area that includes Paris and the
surrounding countryside. By 1250 the style had spread to many parts of Europe,
affecting both sculpture and painting.
The term Gothic was coined in Italy and originally carried a negative
connotation, associating the architectural style with the `Goths' or barbarians
who had destroyed classical civilization. Gothic artists, on the other hand,
referred to their own work as opus modernum or opus francigenum, modern or
French work.
The reconstructed royal Abbey Church of Saint-Denis, just north of Paris, is
usually considered the earliest example of Gothic architecture. Between 1137
and 1144, Abbot Suger commissioned a new choir for the church. It was built
with larger windows and taller arches and thus seemed lofty and weightless, a
strong contrast to the somber solidity of the earlier, Romanesque style.
Gothic architecture was more fully developed at Notre Dame in Paris (begun in
1163) and Chartres (rebuilt from 1194 to 1220). Flying buttresses and external
arches were erected to support the weight of the building on the outside. These
massive structures allowed more stained glass windows to be cut into the walls,
thus making their interiors brighter and more resplendent with color.
The influence of Gothic architecture outside of France is visible at Salisbury
Cathedral (begun in 1220) and the Duomo (Cathedral) of Orvieto, Italy (begun
circa 1310).
In northern Europe, Gothic painting is most commonly seen in stained glass
windows and book illustrations, such as the famous illuminated manuscript,
LesTres Riches Heures du Due de Berry, painted by the three Limbourg brothers
between 1413 and 1416. In Italy, on the other hand, the Gothic style manifests
itself in the paintings of Giotto and Simone Martini.
Sculpture was used extensively to decorate both the interiors and exteriors of
Gothic Cathedrals, as can be seen in the magnificent portals at Chartres or at
Naumburg Cathedral in Germany.
The Gothic style flourished in France and much of Northern Europe until the
early sixteenth century. In Italy, it faded earlier with the onset of the
Renaissance.
ADDITIONAL FACT
1. In the eighteenth century, the word gothic was associated with fiction that
emphasized the grotesque and mysterious; today it often refers to a movement
in music, dress, and culture that began in the 1980s with the work of music
groups such as Siouxsie and the Banshees.
THURSDAY, DAY 4
Nociception: The Perception of Pain
The perception of pain, called nociception, is essential to human survival. Pain is
a simple, effective way to learn about the dangers of the world. It signals us to
react: to recoil from scalding water, to step away from broken glass, to ease off a
twisted ankle.
All higher species, especially those related most closely to us, have nervous
systems that seem to process pain. Although we can't ask them if they are hurt,
birds and mammals writhe, moan, and yelp much the same way that humans do.
Like us, they experience a rise of blood pressure, dilated pupils, perspiration, and
an increased pulse rate in response to a harmful stimulus.
Nociception is a crucial survival tool for complex organisms. Children born with
a rare condition-congenital insensitivity to pain and anhydrosis (CIPA)-seldom
live past age twenty-five. Although these children appear normal at birth, the
trouble begins when they grow teeth: They can bite off their fingers without
feeling a thing. They break bones, burn hands, and scrape knees; but they don't
know they are hurt until they see blood or bruises. They often die from massive
infections caused by multiple injuries.
Cliched as it may sound, pain is truly all in our heads. Different parts of the brain
work together in a network to form what is sometimes called the pain matrix.
Some areas of the matrix tell us about intensity, while others inform us about the
location, duration, and type of pain-burning, throbbing, or sharp. The sensation
of pain triggers the feeling of distress, thanks to a part of the brain called the
anterior cingulate cortex. Interestingly, it does not distinguish between physical
and emotional pain. It responds equally to a broken arm and to a broken heart.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. People who are good at empathizing with others have more active anterior
cingulate cortices. They actually feel other people's pain.
2. Human fetuses develop the neural circuits to feelpain at twenty-nine weeks,
well into the third trimester
3. Newborns who are circumcised without anesthesia show greater responses to
pain at four-month and sixmonth vaccinations.
4. Amputees often complain ofphantom limb pain. They experience intense,
shootingpain that seems to come from the limb that is no longer there. These
cases were some of the first evidence that pain comes, in part, from the brain.
FRIDAY, DAY 5
Baroque Period
The word baroque originates from a Portuguese word meaning "misshapen
pearl." This symbol is an appropriate metaphor for the art, architecture, and
music of the period, which lasted roughly from 1600 to 1750. It was an era of
contrasts-in art, between light and dark colors, smooth and broken surfaces; and
in music, between loud and soft, fast and slow. It was characterized at first by a
simplification of complex Renaissance musical styles, and eventually by ornate
new aesthetic structures that seemed a huge challenge to all previous currents of
thought.
Claudio Monteverdi (1567-1643) was the most influential composer of the early
baroque, and his Orfeo (1607) is generally regarded as the first dramatically and
musically successful opera. Most baroque music was based on the dialogue
between a supporting musical accompaniment called the basso continuo-usually
played on a combination of a chord-playing instrument (like the organ, the
guitar, or the harpsichord) and a bass-line instrument (like the cello, viola da
gamba, or the bassoon) -and an extravagant concerto-like solo line-usually
played on the violin or a wind instrument (such as the recorder, oboe, or flute).
Cadences, or harmonic stopping points, were emphasized, and many works were
divided into sections that alternated between slow and fast tempos, and further
into even, symmetrical musical phrases. Regional dance rhythms such as the
minuet and the gigue were incorporated, and the violin gained prominence
because of its versatility, volume, and ability to highlight strong rhythms. Later
baroque music is characterized by steady rhythm, intense emotion, elaborate
melodic lines, and virtuoso demands on performers.
In the baroque, leading male roles in operas were often performed by castrati,
singers who had been castrated before puberty to maintain their high vocal
ranges. Castrati were noted for their ranges, power, vocal flexibility, and breath
control.
The early baroque emerged in the writing of Italian composers (Monteverdi,
Cavalli), but the style eventually spread to England (Purcell), France (Couperin,
Rameau), and Germany (Schutz, Buxtehude). In the Italian high baroque,
Arcangelo Corelli (c.1653-1713) and Antonio Vivaldi (1678-1741) wrote
beautiful, complex concertos, while in Germany, Georg Philipp Telemann (1681-
1767) and Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750) competed to be the Meister of
church music in parishes and royal courts all across northern Europe.
ADDITIONAL FACT
1. The choirboys of St. Paul's Cathedral in London, the largest baroque cathedral
in Europe, were often kidnapped by choirmasters from other groups and forced
to sing for the competition.
SATURDAY, DAY 6
Metaphysics
Metaphysics is the most general study of reality-what there is, and what it is like.
The first question-What is there?-is explored by ontology, a subfield of
metaphysics. Ontology asks: Is everything that exists material or are there
immaterial things like souls? Are there abstract mathematical objects, like
numbers and sets? Ontology also asks: What does it mean for something to
exist? Is existence a property, like being red, which some things have, and other
things lack? Or is existence just the collection of everything that is, so that there
can't be anything that does not exist? If existence is a property like redness, what
kind of property is it? When I say that horses exist, but unicorns do not, what am
I saying about horses that I am denying about unicorns?
Metaphysics also asks a second type of question, about the features and relations
of things. For example, if there are numbers, do they exist in space and time? Do
they exist contingently; that is, could they have failed to exist, or could they
cease to exist?
Many philosophers share one tenet of metaphysics that believes that there are
two very general kinds of things: substances and properties. Substances are
objects in the ordinary sense, while properties are ways those substances are. For
instance, a sweater is a substance, while the color of a sweater is a property of
the sweater. Many metaphysical questions arise from the notions of substance
and property.
One question that philosophers have long asked is whether properties are
individual or general. To say that properties are general means that for any two
red things, say a sweater and a rose, there is literally a single property called
redness had, or instantiated, by both things. Instantiation is a philosophical term
that describes the relation between a substance and a property. To say that
properties are individual means that there are literally two different properties-
the redness instantiated by my sweater and the redness instantiated by the rose.
And, those properties perfectly resemble one another.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Metaphysics gets its name from the early editors of Aristotle's writings. These
topics are treated in the book that came after Aristotle's Physics. Because the
book had no title of its own, the editors called it Metaphysics-in Greek, "after
physics."
2. What we now call "metaphysics"Aristotle just called ' first philosophy. "
SUNDAY, DAY 7
Joseph
Joseph was Jacob's eleventh son and his first with Rachel. Within the Jewish
faith, Joseph is widely recognized for his trust in God and cagey capacity to live
as a Jew among Gentiles.
Genesis explains that Joseph was Jacob's favorite son-a fact exhibited by Jacob's
gift to him of a multicolored coat-and that Joseph's uncanny abilities to interpret
dreams only exacerbated fraternal jealousies. Famously, Joseph reported one
dream in which his father, mother, and elder brothers would kneel down before
Joseph as his servants. Angered by Joseph's dream, his brothers formed a plot to
kill him. Joseph was only seventeen. They stopped only when the eldest brother,
Reuben, intervened. Instead, they threw Joseph into a pit.
Joseph was eventually discovered and sold to the Egyptian, Potiphar, as a slave.
He served Potiphar dutifully until Potiphar's wife tried to seduce him. When he
refused her advances, she accused him of rape, and Potiphar had Joseph
imprisoned.
Joseph was then sent to j ail where he met an imprisoned servant of the pharaoh
who interpreted his dream. The servant was later released, and when the pharaoh
had a troubling dream, he sought Joseph's advice. Joseph interpreted the dream
to mean Egypt would face seven years of plentiful harvests followed by seven
years of extreme famine. The pharaoh trusted Joseph and stored excess food for
seven years. When Joseph's prophecy came true, the gracious pharaoh gave him
unprecedented power.
As the predicted famine spread throughout the region, Joseph's brothers fled to
Egypt in search of food. In order to punish them for their sins against him,
Joseph disguised himself and took his brother Benjamin as a slave, sending the
others home. Another brother, Judah, begged to be taken in Benjamin's stead.
Joseph saw this as a sign that his brothers had changed.
He allowed his family to move to Egypt. There, he and his eleven brothers
founded the twelve tribes ofIsrael.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. It is speculated that one of the reasons the pharaoh accepted Joseph in the first
place was that the pharaoh may have been a Hyksos, an ethnicity with some
ties to the Hebrews.
2. Joseph's story was adapted by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice into the
musical Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, which debuted on
Broadway in 1982.

WEEK 8

MONDAY, DAY I
The Spread of Islam
After the death of the Prophet Muhammad in 632 AD, the religion that he
founded in Mecca spread with astonishing speed throughout the Middle East.
Muslim armies carrying his banner conquered the Arabian Peninsula, Persia,
Syria, Armenia, Egypt, North Africa, and Afghanistan. In 711 AD, less than a
century after the prophet's death, his followers conquered modern-day Spain,
bringing Islam to Europe.
Stretched over three continents, the Islamic empire, or caliphate, struggled to
maintain its fragile unity. The capital moved from remote Mecca to Damascus,
the oldest city on earth and the caliphs built splendid mosques to cement their
rule.
But in the middle of the eighth century, the caliphate began to fragment. The
largest of the rival caliphates, the Abbasid, moved their capital to Baghdad,
while the Iberian provinces established their own caliphate. Still, during the
medieval period, the Muslim world flourished. Scientists, poets, and
mathematicians turned Baghdad into a fabled city of romance and learning.
To Christian Europe, still in the midst of its Dark Ages, the success of Islam was
terrifying. Muslim armies reached France before finally being turned back by the
Franks under their leader Charles Martel in 732. Some historians see that battle
as a turning point in history, one that prevented the further spread of Islam in
Europe. Later, the pope dispatched European armies to the Middle East to wage
a holy war against the Muslims.
The destruction of the caliphate, however, came from the east. In 1258, Baghdad
was captured by an invading Mongol army. The Mongols torched the city's great
libraries and murdered as many as a million of its inhabitants. The Mongol
leader, a grandson of Genghis Khan, executed the last caliph by rolling him up
inside a carpet and letting his horses stomp him to death.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. During the European Dark Ages, Islamic scholars were more scientifically
advanced than their European counterparts, and many English words related to
science and math, including "algebra" and "chemistry," are derived from
Arabic.
2. During a war in Central Asia in the eighth century, the caliph's army
discovered from a prisoner ofwar the Chinese secret ofhow to make paper.
3. One of the most famous books from the caliphate is The Thousand and One
Nights, a collection oftales and fables that has enjoyed immense popularity in
the West since it was first translated in the eighteenth century.
TUESDAY, DAY 2
Catch-22
Joseph Heller's Catch-22 gave the English language one of its finest war novels
and black comedies, and a now-common figure of speech. Upon publication in
1961, the unusual work met with mixed reviews: Some called it brilliant; others,
shocking and offensive. In any case, Catch-22 was a landmark protest novel that
introduced absurdity and surrealism into mainstream American literature.
The protagonist of Catch-22, Yossarian, is a US Air Force bombardier based on
the small Italian island of Pianosa during World War II. His squadron is run by
comically inept generals who promise the airmen that they will be sent home
after they complete a certain number of missions-but then keep increasing this
required number of missions so no one can leave. The war's bureaucratic
absurdity is embodied in the simple but insidious Air Force regulation that gives
the novel its title. "Catch-22" states that a soldier can be exempted from combat
missions if he is deemed insane, but if he actually puts in a request for this
exemption, he is clearly sane enough to fly.
The novel is populated with an unforgettable cast of misfits and oddities.
Squadron commander Major Major Major (so named because his father thought
it would be funny) is promoted all the way to the rank of major by a computer
glitch on the first day of his career. Mess officer Milo Minderbinder runs a
ruthless black-market syndicate and will do anything for a profit, even signing a
contract with the Germans to bomb his own squadron. And medic Doc Daneeka,
after being "killed off" by a paperwork error, is unable to convince anyone that
he is really still alive least of all his own wife, who appreciates the monthly
payouts from his life insurance policy.
Catch-22's narrative jumps forward and backward in time with no warning and
few contextual clues, mimicking the chaos of the war and leaving the reader
completely disoriented. Meanwhile, the squadron's carnival-house antics make
the novel uproariously funnyuntil things start to turn sinister. A master of black
comedy, Heller reveals plot details gradually and offhandedly until it becomes
clear that what seemed hilarious at the outset is actually deadly serious once the
full truth is known.
Heller said that Catch-22 was not really about World War 11 in particular but
about the absurdity of bureaucracy and authority in the modern world in general.
Indeed, this message gave the novel a cult following among antiestablishment,
countercultural movements of the 1960s.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Catch-22 was originally titled Catch-18, but after Leon Uris's novel Mila 18
appeared earlier in 1961, Heller decided to change the name at the last-minute.
2. Heller flew dozens of bombing missions in American campaigns in Italy and
North Africa during World War I1.
WEDNESDAY, DAY 3
The Cathedral of Notre Dame of Paris
The Gothic Cathedral of Notre Dame is located on the eastern side of the he de
la Cite, an island on the River Seine in the middle of Paris.
The cathedral was built on the site of an ancient Roman temple dedicated to
Jupiter that was replaced in 528 by a Christian church. Inspired by the
magnificence of the recently restored Abbey Church of Saint Denis, Bishop
Maurice de Sully decided to tear down the old Parisian church and build a
grander one. Construction on the new cathedral began in 1163 and continued
until the beginning of the fourteenth century.
As in most Gothic cathedrals, the facade of Notre Dame has three levels. Above
these rise two towers, connected by the gallery of gargoyles,-sculptures of
hideous beasts that were believed to keep evil spirits away from the church.
Below the gallery is the rose window, which is pieced together from hundreds of
stained glass panes and measures over thirty feet in diameter.
Lower down is the Kings' Gallery, which originally contained statues of the
twenty-eight kings of Judah and Israel. During the French Revolution, the
figures were decapitated by angry mobs that thought they were portraits of
French kings. The sculptures were replaced in 1845 by the notable French
architect, Viollet-le-Duc.
On the facade are three entrances to the church. The central and largest portal is
dedicated to Christ in Judgment. To its left stands the portal of the Virgin and to
its right the portal of Saint Anne, the Virgin's mother.
The cathedral has a rich history. In 1185 it was the site from which Heraclius of
Caesarea announced the Third Crusade. In 1431 it staged the coronation of
Henry VI and in 1804, that of Napoleon. During the French Revolution, the
church was initially renamed the Temple of Reason, then the Temple of the
Supreme Being. In 1970, it was used for Charles de Gaulle's funeral.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Victor Hugo wrote The Hunchback of Notre Dame in order to raise public
awareness ofNotre Dame's history at a time when the building was in danger of
being razed.
2. Kilometre zero, which marks the starting point for all distances measured on
French highways, is located on the square in front ofthe cathedral.
THURSDAY, DAY 4
The Placebo Effect
The placebo effect is the beneficial influence of a treatment that has no medical
value. Inject a sick person with salt water or give him a sugar pill, and for some
reason, he often feels better. This is especially true for subjectively assessed
disorders such as migraines, back pain, and depression. The placebo effect may
account for a large part of the therapeutic value we ascribe to medications.
The placebo effect for pain medications has been at least partially explained by
brain chemistry. When the brain experiences pain, it releases endorphins-
chemicals that naturally act like morphine to relieve pain. Brain imaging studies
have shown that when a person takes a placebo, it triggers the release of
endorphins. Neurologically, it's as if he had taken a drug.
There is also the less understood but equally powerful nocebo effect. Often,
when people are told that they are going to experience negative side effects from
a drug, they do, even if there is no medical reason for it. In one study, people
were given a sugar pill and told that it induced vomiting. Later, 80 percent of
them started throwing up. Similarly, in another study, women who believed they
were going to die of a heart attack were found to be four times more likely to die
of a heart attack than women with the exact same medical profile who did not
think they were at risk. Thinking sick may make you sick.
In some realms of medical treatment, the placebo effect actually seems to be
getting bigger. In studies of antidepressants, the response rate to placebos has
been increasing by 7 percent every ten years. In 1980, 30 percent of depressed
people given a placebo improved without any other treatment; in 2000, it was 44
percent. This may be due to widespread advertising and heightened expectations
for drugs. In general, the public has more faith in psychiatric medication than it
did twenty years ago, which gives placebos more power.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. The color ofpills may also have an effect on some patients. In one Italian
study, blue placebos made excellent sleeping pills for women but had the
opposite effect on men.
2. Painful injections may have more therapeutic value than ones that hurt less.
Form
The term form, when used in classical music, refers to the structures that guide
the composition of a piece-a set of characteristics that are common to a
substantial number of works. There are several important forms that determine
how compositions are divided into movements and thematic sections. They serve
as blueprints for each piece.
BINARY FORM (A-B): The first section of the piece (A) begins in the tonic key
then modulates (changes key) to what is called the dominant key or the relative
major key. The second section (B) begins in the dominant or the relative major
key and then modulates back to the home key. So, if the piece is in A-major, the
A section begins in A-major, then modulates to the key of E. The B section
begins in E and then modulates back to A-major. If the piece is in A-minor, the A
section begins in that key and modulates to C-major, and the B section reverses
that process.
TERNARY FORM (A-B-A): The A section is in the tonic key, the B section is in
the dominant key or relative major, and then the first section is repeated, making
sure the piece ends where it started, in the tonic.
COMPOUND BINARY FORM: Also called sonata form, this is a three-part
structure. The first part, called the exposition, establishes the home key; presents
a main theme and additional, often contrasting themes; and creates tension by
modulating away from the home key. In the second part, called the development,
the composer presents thematic material in a variety of combinations and guises,
often modulating extensively. The third part, the recapitulation, brings back the
initial themes and ends the piece in the same key as it started.
RONDO FORM: This is a variant on ternary form, and it takes the form A-B-A-
C-A-D-A, with each letter representing a thematic section. Each of the parts B-
C-D is called an episode and acts as harmonic and melodic complements to the
initial A theme.
THEME AND VARIATION: The composer presents a melody and then varies
that melody through ornamentation, changes in harmony, changes in texture,
changes from major to minor, and other techniques. This form can be
represented by the letters A-A'-A"-A"', etc )
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Shades ofsonata form first appeared in Bach's late baroque pieces, but the
adoption ofthe form is one ofthe biggest stylistic changes to mark the transition
between the baroque era and the classical era. Mozart was a master ofsonata
form.
2. Both Bach (Goldberg Variations) and Mozart (Variations on "Twinkle,
Twinkle, Little Star") were interested in theme and variation.
SATURDAY, DAY 6
Matter/Form
Aristotle's (384-322 BC) theory of matter and form is one of the most important
and influential aspects of his philosophy. However, it is a subtle doctrine and not
often well understood. At its core, it was an attempt to explain the natural world
before the advances of modern science.
Aristotle saw that the world was populated by substances-concrete individual
things, like plants and animals. You can think of substances as the sort of things
that typically function as the subjects of sentences when we speak about them.
For instance, Socrates is a substance because we say, "Socrates is pale." Aristotle
called certain qualities of substances, such as the quality of being pale, accidents.
Accidents are things said of substances; when we speak about them, they usually
function in sentences as adjectives.
Another way of grasping this difference is through Aristotle's distinction
between accidental change and substantial change. An example of an accidental
change is when Socrates goes from being pale to being tan, after spending time
in the sun. Socrates, the substance, persists, and what changes are mere accidents
of Socrates, his paleness and his tan. An example of a substantial change is the
death of Socrates. In this case, a genuine substance, Socrates, goes out of
existence.
This idea of substantial change leads to Aristotle's matter/form theory. Even
when Socrates dies, his corpse continues to exist. Something persists. Aristotle
identifies matter as that which persists through substantial change. However, the
matter of Socrates, which once contained various intricate biological processes,
has ceased those processes. Now that he is dead, the matter remains but the
matter's form has changed. Form is defined as the principle of organization and
activity that determined how Socrates' many parts interacted.
Aristotle concluded that individual substances are combinations of matter and
form. In his works on natural philosophy, Aristotle used the matter/form theory
to explain a wide variety of natural phenomena.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Aristotle's theory ofmatter and form is called hylomorphism.
2. Aristotle's hylomorphism had a huge impact on Western Christianity, through
St. Thomas Aquinas, who made it one ofthe pillars ofhis own metaphysics.
3. Rene Descartes (1596-1650) severely criticized the use ofAristotelian
substantial forms in the physics of the seventeenth century.
SUNDAY, DAY 7
Moses
Moses is generally recognized as one of most important Biblical figures in
Jewish history.
The Hebrew people, descendents of Abraham, left Israel during a drought and
settled in Egypt, where one of Jacob's sons, Joseph, was well-liked by the
pharaoh. As time passed, and the pharaoh's friendship with Joseph was
forgotten, the Hebrew people became the slaves of the Egyptians.
Moses was born to Amram and Jochebed in Egypt during the reign of a
particularly vicious pharaoh, Ramses II, who decreed that Hebrew slave children
should be killed. At first, Jochebed succeeded in hiding Moses, but this
eventually proved too difficult. When Moses was three months old, his mother
put him in a basket and pushed him down the Nile River, hoping someone kind
would find him. As it turned out, the pharaoh's daughter found Moses and raised
him as her own son.
Moses grew up and finally learned his true heritage. Shortly thereafter, he saw an
Egyptian beating an Israelite; and, in response, Moses killed the Egyptian.
Having committed such a heinous crime, Moses was forced to flee Egypt and
live in the Sinai Peninsula for forty years. One day, Moses saw a bush that was
on fire but not burning. When Moses inspected it more closely, God commanded
him to return to Egypt and lead the Israelites out of Egypt.
Moses then returned to Egypt and tried to persuade the pharaoh to free the
Hebrews. The pharaoh refused, causing God to send ten plagues against the
Egyptians. The tenth plaguethe killing of the firstborn son in all Egyptian
families-proved to be the breaking point, and pharaoh freed the Israelites.
However, after allowing the Israelites to leave, pharaoh pursued them. By the
time the Israelites reached the Sea of Reed (Red Sea), pharaoh's armies had
caught up to them and trapped them. In order to save them, God parted the Red
Sea for the Israelites, only to close it afterward, drowning the Egyptians. After
passing the sea, Moses led the Hebrews through the desert to Mount Sinai,
where he ascended the mountain alone and received the Ten Commandments
directly from God.
Although the historical truth of Moses's existence is debatable, as a leader and
lawgiver, he is the foremost icon of Jewish history.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Some theories claim that Moses was not Hebrew at all, but rather a renegade
and sympathetic Egyptian priest.
2. The anti-Semitic stereotype that Jews have horns most likely stems from a
mistranslation of Moses's description after he descended from Mount Sinai.
Being so close to God allegedly changed his physical appearance, but it is said
that "rays of lightprotruded from his face,"and not, as some mistakenly
believed that "horns protruded from his head."
Charlemagne
After the collapse of the Roman Empire in 476 AD, Europe entered a period of
war and anarchy that later historians would label the Dark Ages. Rival tribes
fought constantly over the decaying remains of the empire. Progress in the arts
and sciences stalled. Without the unity provided by Rome, there was little
holding the continent together.
Charlemagne (742-814), the leader of a kingdom in modern-day Germany,
created a large European empire in the eighth century that for the first time
reunited many of the territories that once belonged to the Western Roman
Empire. On Christmas Day in 800 AD, the pope crowned him the first Holy
Roman Emperor, the leader of newly resurgent Christendom.
At the time of his coronation, Charlemagne's empire included modern-day
France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and most of Germany.
Charlemagne was a king of the Franks, a German tribe that had annexed many
of its neighbors.
The Holy Roman Empire proclaimed in 800 AD never actually united Europe.
As Voltaire joked in the eighteenth century, it was neither "holy," nor "Roman,"
nor an "empire" By one count, it comprised more than 300 semi-independent
principalities, some of them no bigger than a few square miles. Still, it was a
major force in central Europe for centuries to come. Charlemagne's forces
spread Christianity and fought (unsuccessfully) to reclaim territory held by the
Muslim caliphate in Spain.
Charlemagne's legacy is still seen across Europe-literally. Recent genetic studies
show that a large percentage of Europeans descend from the Frankish king. He is
considered one of the founding fathers of France and Germany. His empire, in
reduced form, endured until the last Holy Roman Emperor abdicated in 1806.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. The sword Charlemagne carried into battle was named joyeuse; a weapon
thought to be the famous sword is now housed at the Louvre Museum in Paris.
2. In popular medieval legend, Charlemagne was one of the "nine worthies," the
greatest knights of history. Other worthies included King Arthur and Alexander
the Great.
3. During a battle in Spain in 778 AD, one of Charlemagne's noblemen, Roland,
was killed by Basques. The story ofRoland's courageous death became the
foundation for the Song of Roland, one of the most famous pieces of medieval
literature.
TUESDAY, DAY 2
Gabriel Garcia Marquez
Colombian author Gabriel Garcia Marquez, more than probably any other figure,
is responsible for drawing the world's attention to Latin American literature
during the twentieth century. In his novels and short stories, he has explored the
history and people of his home continent through a lens that combines real
events with pervasive currents of fantasy and myth.
Born in the town of Aracataca in northern Colombia in 1928, Garcia Marquez
grew up immersed in family stories told and retold by his elders, particularly his
grandparents. After college, he worked as a journalist for various foreign press
agencies, living in France, Venezuela, the United States, and Mexico. He began
writing fiction in the mid-1950s and published his first major work, the short
story collection No One Writes to the Colonel, in 1961.
Garcia Marquez's masterpiece is unquestionably the novel One Hundred Years
of Solitude (1967), a sprawling tale of six generations in the fictional town of
Macondo. The history of the town and its founders-the Buendia family-mirrors
the historical trends of Latin America as a whole: As Macondo comes into
increasing contact with the outside world, it passes from unspoiled pastoral
isolation through civil war, dictatorship, labor unrest, and other hardships that
accompany the transition to modernity. In the novel, history moves cyclically as
both individuals and groups repeat the same mistakes over and overa fact that
Garcia Marquez emphasizes by giving characters in different generations of the
Buendia family the same names.
Many of Garcia Marquez's works exemplify the genre that has been dubbed
magic realism-a mix of highly realistic depiction with significant elements of the
fantastic and supernatural. During One Hundred Years of Solitude, among other
occurrences, Macondo sees a torrential rainstorm that lasts for five years, a
cascade of yellow flowers from the sky upon news of a character's death, and the
birth of an infant with a pig's tail. Within the context of magic realism, most of
these events are accepted as commonplace, and the characters witness them
without comment or wonder.
After two other major releases-the novel The Autumn of the Patriarch (1975)
and the novella Chronicle of a Death Foretold (1981)-Garcia Marquez was
awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1982. His works have sold tens
ofmillions ofcopies in the original Spanish and in translation, counting him
among the few contemporary novelists who have maintained both critical and
popular success.
ADDITIONAL FACT
1. Many of Garcia Mlrquezs works takeplace in the same fictional universe, with
some ofthe same characters and locations popping up indifferent stories and
novels.
WEDNESDAY, DAY 3
Renaissance Art
The period known as the Renaissance followed the Middle Ages and led to the
modern era. The word is derived from renascere, Latin for "to be born again,"
and it refers to the rebirth of Greek and Roman culture. Artists and intellectual
figures of the Renaissance consciously rejected the ideas of the Middle Ages and
sought inspiration in classical models.
The roots of the Renaissance can be traced as far back as the early fourteenth
century when the Italian poet Francesco Petrarch developed a philosophy that
placed great value on individualism and human achievement. This marked a
change from medieval society's complete preoccupation with God's power.
In terms of the visual arts, the Renaissance began in Florence in the early
fifteenth century. It was at this time that sculptors and architects began to seek
ancient models to work from. At the same time, painters invented one-point
perspective, a system to represent depth and volume on a two-dimensional
surface.
Renowned Florentine artists of the Early Renaissance include the sculptor
Donatello, whose David was the first freestanding nude since antiquity;
Brunelleschi, the architect who designed the famous Dome of the Cathedral in
Florence; and Masaccio, who was the first painter known to use one-point
perspective.
The High Renaissance, which is usually dated 1495-1527, produced some of the
greatest masters of European civilization, such as Leonardo da Vinci,
Michelangelo, Raphael, and Titian. It was in this period, too, that work began on
the reconstruction of St. Peter's Basilica. The architect Bramante initiated the
process and designed the first version of the new church. Work on the project
continued after his death under the supervision of many artists, including
Michelangelo. The new basilica was not completed until the mid-seventeenth
century.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. In northern Europe, the Renaissance was slower to arrive as the Gothic style
continued to prevail until the sixteenth century.
2. The Late Renaissance generally refers to theperiod between 1527 and 1600.
Works produced in this period are often referred to as "Mannerist, "since they
are highly complex inform and rich in esoteric intellectual conceits.
THURSDAY, DAY 4
Mendelian Genetics
When Gregor Mendel, a Czech monk, began his pea experiments in the mid-
1800s, there were two leading theories of inheritance. The first stated that the
traits of parents blend together equally to create a child. The second proposed
that the environment in which a child was conceived shaped his features. Mendel
disproved them both.
On his frequent walks through the gardens of his monastery, Mendel noted the
simple traits of a common pea plant (Pisum sativum). He noticed that the flowers
of the plants were either purple or white-nothing in between-and that the pods
were either yellow or green. The stein was either long or short, and the seeds
were either round or wrinkled. In total, he found seven traits that never seemed
to blend together, and so he began to experiment.
When Mendel bred green-podded peas with yellow-podded peas, their offspring
all turned out green-podded. But when he bred this first generation with itself,
one quarter of the next generation turned out yellow-podded. The same thing
happened with height. When he bred long-stemmed peas with short-stemmed
peas, the following generation was all tall, but onequarter of the grandchildren's
generation was short.
This pattern led Mendel to conceive of what would later be called alleles, genes,
and dominantrecessive inheritance. Essentially, Mendel concluded that each
plant received one hereditary unit, or allele, from each parent for each trait, or
gene. Although only one of the alleles would be outwardly expressed-the
dominant allele-both had an equal chance of being passed on to the next
generation. So, after the long-stemmed peas were mated with short-stemmed
peas, their offspring all had a dominant allele for tallness and a recessive allele
for shortness. They all appeared tall but they all carried an unexpressed allele for
shortness. So, when that generation was mated with itself, one quarter of their
offspring had two alleles for tallness, half had a tall and a short allele (they
appeared tall), and one quarter had two alleles for shortness. Those with two
shortness alleles appeared short. This basic observation is the foundation of
modern genetics and explains why certain traits appear to skip generations.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Between 1856 and 1863, Mendel cultivated and tested approximately 28, 000
pea plants.
2. Although Mendel kept excellent records, his results often struck later
scientists as being too exact. They generally suspect him of falling prey to
confirmation bias and smoothing his data.
3. Mendel's work was largely ignored in his lifetime, and he died in obscurity.
Botanists rediscovered his work in 1900, and it changed the study ofgenetics
forever.
FRIDAY, DAY 5
Antonio Vivaldi
Born a sickly child to a Venetian violinist, Antonio Vivaldi (1678-1741) entered
the priesthood in 1703. He quickly became a violin teacher, a conductor, and a
composer-in-residence at the Pio Ospedale della Pieta, a Venetian conservatory
for orphaned girls. The young women were trained rigorously in music, and their
concerts, often comprised of Vivaldi's original works, were very popular with the
city's music-loving audiences.
Vivaldi was stunningly prolific, producing more than 500 concertos in his
lifetime, more than any other known composer. Although Vivaldi composed
vocal works, most of his pieces are instrumental, and he is most famous in that
area. His concertos are beautifully expressive, covering a range of emotions,
from delicate sadness to majestic bombast.
Many of Vivaldi's works were programmatic-meant to tell a story, evoke an
emotion, or give the impression of real-life events, usually in the cycle of nature.
The concertos often took the form of three movements: an Allegro (brisk tempo)
movement, a slow movement in the same or related key, and a concluding
allegro movement, even more lively than the first.
Vivaldi's compositions have titles like The Night, The Storm at Sea, and The
Goldfinch, but his most famous is The Four Seasons, a catchy set of four
concertos that remains one of the most popular pieces of Western classical music
today. With this and other pieces, Vivaldi revolutionized the role of the soloist,
giving it unprecedented importance with his extraordinary sense of drama and
flourish. Vivaldi also had a huge influence on Johann Sebastian Bach and on the
composers of the classical era with his memorable themes, adventurous rhythmic
motifs, and the overall clarity of his compositions.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. An abbreviation of the words Lau s Deo Beataeque Mariae Deiparae Amen
appeared at the top of most of Vivaldi's manuscripts. It means, "Honor to God
and to Blessed Mary [the mother of God]."
2. Vivaldi is thought to have earned 50,000 ducats a year at one point in his life,
one of the highest salaries paid for a musician at that time.
SATURDAY, DAY 6
Logic
Logic is the study of formally valid arguments. An argument consists of several
sentences that are premises, or assumptions, and a sentence that states a
conclusion. Here is an example:
This is an instance of a valid argument. A valid argument is an argument in
which the truth of the conclusion follows from the truth of its premises. Notice,
however, that the validity of this argument does not depend on anything about
Socrates, manhood, or mortality. It is valid because its schema, or construction,
is valid. The following is a schematic presentation of the same argument:
1.p
2. Ifp then q
3. Therefore, q
No matter what sentences we fill in for p and q, this is a valid argument. The
original argument (1)-(3) is the same argument, only with particular sentences
filled-in for p and q. Words like "and, "or," "some," and "any" are called logical
terms. The study of logic examines which schemas for arguments are valid. It
examines the relation between different logical terms like "if-then" and "and"
and the roles they play in building valid arguments
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Ever since Aristotle developed the first logical system, logic has often been
considered the first subject one should learn in philosophy.
2. Gottlob Frege (1848-1925) invented modern logic in his 1879 work
Begriffschrif. Although Frege revolutionized logic, he is almost unknown
outside the field.
3. The principle that every truth is either true or false is denied by some
philosophers. Other philosophers even deny that all contradictions are false!
SUNDAY, DAY 7
King David
King David, who ruled after King Saul, was Israel's second and greatest king. He
was the son of Jesse and was raised as a shepherd. His story is told in the Book
of Samuel, and he is perhaps most well known for the story of David and
Goliath.
Goliath was a Philistine and a giant, estimated by some to be nine and one-half
feet tall. At the time of his encounter with David, the Philistines were at war
with the Israelites. Before marching into battle, however, Goliath challenged the
Israelites to send out a warrior who could defeat him. Goliath made this
challenge daily for forty days, but no Israelite accepted it. Finally, David, who
was still a teenager and was only present at the battleground because he was
bringing food to his older brothers, rose to the occasion.
King Saul was amused by David's bravery and offered him a weapon and armor,
but David refused. He marched out to meet Goliath armed only with a sling and
some stones. Before Goliath could strike, David slung a stone that hit Goliath in
the head, knocking him down. David then seized Goliath's sword and
decapitated him, completing the upset victory.
From this moment on, David's popularity soared throughout Israel. King Saul
began to perceive him as a threat and tried to have him killed. Saul's own son
and heir, Jonathan, befriended David and helped him survive. Eventually, David
was chosen to succeed Saul as Israel's second king.
As king, David unified the Northern and Southern tribes of Israel and moved the
capital to Jerusalem. He ruled for approximately forty years beginning around
1000 BC, but not without difficulty. While king, David fell in love with and
impregnated a married woman named Bathsheba. In order to cover up his sin, he
ordered that her husband, a soldier in his army, be sent to the frontlines where he
was killed. In response, God dispatched a prophet, Nathan, to confront David
with his crime.
Despite his imperfection, Jewish belief holds that God promised David his
lineage would rule Israel forever. The Jewish messianic tradition therefore holds
that when the Messiah arrives, he will be a descendant of David.
ADDITIONAL FACT
1. It is speculated that Goliath's size may have been the result of a pituitary gland
defect, causing abnormal growth. Another hypothetical symptom ofthis defect
would be tunnel vision, perhaps explaining how David could have sneaked up
on him without Goliath's knowledge.

WEEK 9

MONDAY, DAY I
Magna Carta
In 1214, England's King John was defeated in a war with France's King Philip II.
John returned home and attempted to rebuild his royal treasury by levying heavy
taxes on the barons who had not supported his overseas campaign. The barons
rebelled and by summer 1215 captured London.
With the fall of London, King John negotiated a settlement at Runnymede, a
meadow by the River Thames. The settlement was a guarantee of basic liberties
and a series of limits on the absolute power of the king, summarized in a
proclamation called the Magna Carta. On June 19, the Magna Carta was affixed
with the royal seal and ordered to be read throughout the land. It bound not only
King John but his heirs, forever.
The first draft of the agreement applied to any baron, but the language was
changed to any freeman in the final version. At the time freemen were a minority
of the English population, but over the centuries, the term would come to include
all citizens.
The first section of the Magna Carta promised that the Church in England "shall
be free, and shall have its rights undiminished, and its liberties unimpaired"
Subsequent clauses codified the feudal relationship between the king and his
nobles. There were also guarantees that no man could be imprisoned without due
process, and there was a provision that no feudal taxes could be imposed without
the kingdom's "general consent." The final clause established a council of barons
and clergy that was authorized to use force against the crown to enforce the
agreement.
The Magna Carta is considered the bedrock of freedom and rule of law in
England and the earliest seed of constitutional monarchy. However, it was
largely ignored for hundreds of years after it was issued. Pope Innocent II
annulled the document that very September. It was reissued in 1217, but was
considered legally irrelevant.
The Magna Carta's importance was revived by Sir Edward Coke, a parliamentary
leader in the seventeenth century, who repeatedly cited its principles in his fight
against the Stuart kings. And, it was later an inspiration to the American
colonists in their fight for independence.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Magna Carta means "Great Charter" in Latin.
2. Four original copies of the Magna Carta survive. Two copies are stored at the
British Library while the others can be seen in the cathedral archives at Lincoln
and Salisbury.
3. In 1957 the American Bar Association acknowledged the debt American law
had to the Magna Carta by erecting a monument at Runnymede.
TUESDAY, DAY 2
"Ozymandias"
Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792-1822) was one of the principal English Romantic
poets of the early 1800s. These poets reacted against the rationalism that had
dominated art and literature during the Enlightenment of the 1700s, celebrating
instead the sublimity of nature and the power of human emotion, passion, and
freedom.
Shelley's "Ozymandias" (1818) is a sonnet, the same strict fourteen-line verse
form that Petrarch, Spenser, Shakespeare, and others had used during the
Renaissance. Usually, a sonnet is written in iambic pentameter, with each line
composed of five iambs (two-syllable units that follow an unstressed-stressed
pattern). Moreover, a Petrarchan sonnet, like "Ozymandias," typically is divided
into two parts: the opening eight lines, or octave, and the final six, or sestet.
Often, the octave poses a question that the sestet answers; in "Ozymandias," the
octave paints an image upon which the sestet comments ironically.
The speaker in "Ozymandias" relays a story he has heard of a once-great statue
now lying broken and toppled in the desert. The statue's "frown" and "sneer of
cold command" arrogantly convey the power that Ozymandias held. This
arrogance reaches a height in the statue's boastful inscription-"Look on my
Works, ye Mighty, and despair!"-which immediately is undercut by the image of
the vast sands that long ago buried these "Works" and surrounded the statue with
nothingness.
Shelley's critique of political power and its ability to endure in the face of time,
nature, and history is typical of the Romantic outlook. Implicit in "Ozymandias"
is the suggestion that there is more lasting value in art than in any temporal
political authority. After all, the poem and the images contained within it, have
endured far longer than the reign of any human ruler.
ADDITIONAL FACT
1. "Ozymandias" was inspired by a fallen statue at the funerary temple of
Ramses II near Luxor, Egypt. According to the ancient historian Diodorus, the
statue was once inscribed with the words, "King ofKings am I, Ozymandias.
Ifanyone would know how great lam and where Ilie, let him surpass one ofmy
works."
WEDNESDAY, DAY 3
The Birth of Venus
The Birth of Venus by the Italian painter Sandro Botticelli (1446-1510) captures
the moment when Venus, the goddess of beauty, is being blown to shore after her
birth from the sea. The work was painted in tempera on wood around 1482 for a
villa in Castello owned by the wealthy Florentine banking family, the Medici.
In the Early Renaissance, many artists were influenced by neoPlatonist thinkers,
such as Marsilio Ficino, who felt that Greek and Roman culture could be
reconciled with Christian beliefs. In the 1480s Botticelli was commissioned by
the Medici to execute a series of large-scale paintings that combined pagan
mythology with Christian concepts. Among these were such masterpieces as his
Primavera, Pallas and the Centaur, and The Birth of Venus.
According to Greek legend, Venus was born from the foam that appeared on the
sea's surface when the Titan Chronos castrated his father Uranus and threw his
genitals into the ocean. The goddess came ashore on the island of Cyprus, where
her cult later flourished. According to Neo-Platonic thought, the legend of
Venus's birth was an allegory for the creation of the human soul.
In Botticelli's painting, two wind gods, one of whom is Zephyrus, blow Venus to
land. The goddess, who stands on a large scallop shell, is modeled on the ancient
Venus pudica (modest Venus) type, such as the ones carved by the Greek
sculptor Praxiteles. Roses float in the air around her as she is greeted by a
woman, possibly the nymph Pomona, who prepares to drape a flower-covered
garment over her newly born body. Both the roses and the leaves of the orange
trees are painted with accents of gold.
Later in life, Botticelli fell under the influence of a charismatic Dominican monk
named Girolamo Savonarola. Savonarola organized a "Bonfire of the Vanities"
in 1497 to encourage people to destroyluxury objects. Repenting his interest in
pagan culture, Botticelli supposedly burned some of his own works.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Today The Birth of Venus can be seen in the Uffzi Galleries in Florence.
2. The orange grove on the right, with its dark green leaves accented with gold,
may represent the Garden of Hespeides of Greek mythology.
3. The woman offering Venus a robe is wearing a dress adorned with daisies,
primroses, and cornflowers-all spring flowers appropriate for celebrating a
birth.
THURSDAY, DAY 4
Surface Tension and Hydrogen Bonding
Water is the strangest, most ubiquitous substance on earth. Its solid form is less
dense than its liquid form, which is why ice floats. It can absorb large amounts
of heat without changing very much, which is why coastal towns have moderate
temperatures. And, it has a "skin," a thin layer of molecules that try to stick
together at the surface.
Water's unusual properties are the result of its shape. A water molecule consists
of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom (H2O). It looks like Mickey
Mouse: the two hydrogen atoms are the ears, and the oxygen atom is the head.
Because electrons aren't distributed evenly in the water molecule, the ears are
positively charged and the head is negatively charged. Since opposites attract,
the ears of one water molecule are attracted to the chin of another water
molecule, forming a hydrogen bond. In ice, water molecules bond together
stably to form a tetrahedron, a four-sided pyramid. But in liquid the structure of
water molecules is looser. Hydrogen bonds are constantly breaking up and
getting back together. In fact, the average hydrogen bond lasts only a fraction of
a second.
In the middle of a glass of water, any given molecule is being pulled equally in
all directions, so there is no net effect. But at the surface, there is no force to pull
water molecules up. Molecules are pulled more to the side and down, which is
what creates water's sticky skin, or surface tension. Surface tension allows us to
fill a glass above the brim. It makes water bead up and form drops and allows it
to be stretched into bubbles.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Water-striders, light insects with pad-like feet, take advantage of water's
surface tension. They literally walk on water.
2. Water's surface tension is strong enough to drown flying insects that
accidentally fall into it. They can't flap their wings fast enough to escape the
pull of the water molecules.
3. Detergents work by lowering surface tension, which allows water to more
effectively soak into pores and dirt.
FRIDAY, DAY 5
The Four Seasons
Antonio Vivaldi wrote The Four Seasons in 1725, each of the four concertos
representing a season of the year. Written for solo violin and a small orchestra,
each concerto is further divided into three movements: the first, an allegro, or
fast section; the second, a slow section called adagio or largo; and the third, a
concluding allegro or presto finale. When Vivaldi published The Four Seasons,
he included four sonnets with the manuscript laying out the impressions he was
trying to give with each season.
The first concerto, "Spring," is in the key of E. Its pulsing pace and jubilant
opening theme are immediately recognizable, spirited, and pleasant. In the
second movement the solo violin is meant to represent a sleeping goat herd, and
the viola part barks like an excited dog.
"Summer," in the key of G minor, has a sterner feel. We hear sounds from the
orchestra that emulate distant thunder in the first movement, and the roar of the
storm arrives in the second movement. The poem for "Summer" includes the
lines "Blazing sun's relentless heat / Men and flocks are sweltering, / Pines are
scorched..."
The program for "Autumn" begins with a peasants' dance to celebrate the
gathering of the harvest, followed by a quiet resting period, and in the morning,
a lively hunt. "The cup of Bacchus flows freely, and many find their relief in
deep slumber," read the accompanying words.
"Winter" evokes "frosty snow in biting, stinging winds," and its slow movement-
a tribute to the peace and quiet of the hearth-moves into a spirited final allegro
that is meant to feel like a romp in the snow and the thrill of slipping along an
icy path.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. The Four Seasons was originally published under the name Ii Cimento dell'
Armonia e dell' Inventione, which means The Contest Between Harmony and
Invention.
2. At one of Vivaldi's performances in 1715, the audience was wowed by his
virtuosity on the violin. One account reads, `Everyone was astounded."
3. Vivaldi, like Mozart after him, died poor and was buried in an unmarked
grave.
SATURDAY, DAY 6
Stoics
The Stoics were a philosophical school that flourished in the Greco-Roman
world from the fourth century BC to the second century AD. Originating with
Zeno of Cilium in Cypress (344-262 BC), but eventually spreading to Athens,
Rome, and the rest of the Empire, Stoicism had a major influence on ancient
civilization.
Although they are best known for their ethical views, the Stoics also had views
on logic, epistemology, metaphysics, and natural science. The Stoics believed
living things were composed of passive matter and an active force they called
pneuma. They identified God as the intelligent designer of the world who keeps
it evolving and changing according to strict natural laws.
The most important question for the Stoics was how a person should live. Their
answer was: One should seek happiness-in Greek, eudaimonia. But what is
happiness? For the Stoics, happiness was an "excellent activity of the soup'-
being virtuous, courageous, modest, and patient. They believed it was reasonable
to desire things like wealth, fame, and health, but happiness had nothing to do
with actually possessing them. Indeed, the Stoics believed that a person who was
fully virtuous could be happy regardless of his physical well-being. He could be
happy even while being tortured.
Further, the Stoics believed that emotions are not merely feelings, but always
involve beliefs. For instance, they thought being afraid of disease required
believing that disease was bad. However, since a truly virtuous person could be
happy in the face of disease, it was wrong to believe that disease is bad.
Therefore, the Stoics recommended purging emotion.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. The Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius (121-180 AD) is a famous Stoic. His
personal diary, known as the Meditations, is an important work of Stoic
philosophy.
2. The Stoics got their name from the porch (stoa poikile) in the Agora at
Athens, where they gathered to discuss philosophy.
SUNDAY, DAY 7
King Solomon
King Solomon was King David's second son with Bathsheba and successor to
the throne of Israel. During his reign, Solomon consolidated his power through
political marriages and friendly relations with Egypt and Tyre, and he became
known for his abiding wisdom and sense of justice.
Solomon's reign as king was a glorious one, at least initially. It was under his
rule that the first temple in Jerusalem was built, in the tenth century BC. The
temple was the center of Jewish worship, as well as the home of the Ark of the
Covenant, which contained the original Ten Commandments. It stood for nearly
400 years until it was destroyed by the Babylonian ruler Nebuchadrezzar II in
the sixth century BC. In addition to the temple, King Solomon brought great
wealth to the kingdom of Israel, in the form of other ornate structures and stores
of gold.
While the temple was perhaps Solomon's greatest accomplishment, it was also
an early cause of his downfall, criticized by some as being pagan. It was known
to have reflected Canaanite and Phoenician architecture and was seen by critics
as an idolized monument, forbidden in Judaism.
Solomon established peace through alliances and political marriage. In 1 Kings
11:3, it is said that he had 700 wives and 300 concubines. For all of the political
benefits, Solomon's polygamy led to significant internal strife as many of the
women practiced idol worship and he did little to enforce Jewish traditions upon
them. Tensions grew as many doubted his leadership, and after he died, the
northern and southern parts of Israel split apart after nearly a century of
unification.
Still, King Solomon is remembered for his great wisdom, epitomized by the
following story. Two women went before Solomon claiming a baby was theirs.
Solomon, in a surprising decision, ordered the baby cut in half. While the false
mother was willing to allow this, the true mother-not wanting any harm to come
to her child-asked Solomon to let the other woman take the baby. Thus,
Solomon, knowing no woman would allow harm to her own child, was able to
ascertain the identity of the true mother.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Solomon's first temple, which was destroyed in 586BC was replaced by the
second temple, completed in 515 BC. The second temple was subsequently
destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD It is believed that during the coming of the
Messiah, a third temple will be built on the same spot as the first two.
2. After the Babylonians destroyed the temple, the Ark of the Covenant
disappeared. While it is assumed that the Ark was stolen and destroyed, some
people believe that it exists and is hidden.

WEEK 10

MONDAY, DAY I
Genghis Khan
Genghis Khan (1160-1227) was a Mongol warrior, who in the span of two
decades led his ruthless army of nomadic tribesman to conquer vast stretches of
Asia. When he died in 1227 AD, the Mongol Empire he founded was the largest
contiguous empire in the history of the world. Although the empire quickly
disintegrated under his heirs, the bloody Mongol invasions marked a turning
point in the history of both Europe and Asia and earned the Mongol king a
reputation for brutality that endures to the present.
Genghis Khan was born as Temujin, the son of a Mongol chieftain. The Mongols
in eastern Asia traditionally lived a nomadic lifestyle, wandering from one
region to the next. After the murder of his father, Temujin became chief of a
Mongol tribe at age thirteen. He was a charismatic leader. Temujin was
eventually able to unify the rest of the Mongol tribes, whose leaders then named
him Genghis Khan-the "emperor of all emperors."
After unifying the Mongols, Genghis began a campaign of conquest that would
last the rest of his life. His armies conquered portions of modern-day China,
Russia, Mongolia, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Kazakstan, Turkmenistan,
Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyztan. At its height, shortly after Genghis Khan's death, the
Mongol empire stretched from Korea to Eastern Europe.
The Mongol armies were disciplined, effective, and notoriously vicious. Their
usual strategy was to give an enemy city the opportunity to surrender peacefully
but then kill every resident if the offer was refused. As a result of such terror,
Genghis Khan was able to convince whole nations to surrender without a fight.
Before the Mongols, contact between Europe and Asia was minimal. But the
Mongol empire founded by Genghis Khan opened the way for trade and the
exchange of ideas between the two continents. The Mongols opened the Silk
Road, a trade route between Asia and Europe, and Europeans, such as the Italian
Marco Polo, traveled to the land of the Khans.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Mongol nomads lived in round tents known as yurts, which could be moved
whenever the tribe migrated to a different region. About halfofMongolia's
population still herds livestock, although many nomads settled in the cities
during the last half of the twentieth century.
2. For centuries, the splendors of the Mongol Empire fascinated Western writers.
A luxurious summer capital built by Kublai Khan, the grandson of Genghis,
inspired the famous 1797 poem "Kubla Khan" by the British romantic poet
Samuel Taylor Coleridge.
3. The Mongols repeatedly tried to invade the island of japan, but their crude
navy was destroyed by wind. In Japan, the legend ofthe kamikaze (divine
wind) was passed down for centuries as evidence ofjapan's invincibility. At the
end of World War II, desperate Japanese pilots crashed their planes into
American ships in suicide missions meant to recreate the divine wind that had
saved Japan from the Mongols.
TUESDAY, DAY 2
William Faulkner
William Faulkner (1897-1962) is considered the greatest literary voice of the
American South. In his novels and short stories, he broke new stylistic ground
while confronting the South's considerable ghosts-the Civil War, Reconstruction,
and the decline of the old aristocracy.
Faulkner was born and raised in Mississippi, which is the setting for most of his
works. His family was prominent and well established, with roots in the state
going back generations; his great-grandfather had been a Confederate colonel
in the Civil War and a local legend. As a young man, Faulkner bounced around
between various jobs, including a stint in the Royal Canadian Air Force and a
position as a clerk in his grandfather's bank. All the while he attempted to gain
notoriety as a poet.
Faulkner's first major success was not a poem but a novel, The Sound and the
Fury (1929), which is still considered his finest. It details the slow decline of the
once-great Compson family, which reaches rock bottom in its dysfunctional final
generation of children: suicidal Quentin, promiscuous Caddy, hateful Jason, and
mentally retarded Benjy. Throughout, Faulkner writes in a stream-of-
consciousness narrative and discards any notion of a chronological plot.
The Sound and the Fury is just one of many novels in which Faulkner explores
the decline of the old South and the seeming irrelevance of its values in the
modern world. Many of these works share the same setting-fictional
Yoknapatawpha County, Mississippi-with many of the same places and family
names popping up in different books. Foremost among Faulkner's other
Yoknapatawpha novels are: As I Lay Dying (1930), describes a family's journey
to bury its deceased matriarch; Light in August (1932), recounts the tribulations
of man of uncertain racial heritage; and Absalom, Absalom! (1936), portrays a
man obsessed with building his own southern dynasty.
Faulkner's works are notorious for their thematic and narrative difficulty.
Absurdly long sentences overflowing with adjectives, stream-of-consciousness
narration, twists and turns of time, and multiple (and often unreliable) narrators
lay a thorny path for the reader. But the end result of these techniques is a body
of work that explores the South with greater depth than any other author. For this
achievement, Faulkner was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1950. He
died in Byhalia, Mississippi, in 1962.
ADDITIONAL FACT
1. Due to Faulkner's thick southern drawl, few in the audience at his Nobel Prize
acceptance speech had any idea what he said until the text ofhis remarks was
published in newspapers the next day. Since then, it has been acclaimed as one
of the finest Nobel Prize acceptance speeches in history.
WEDNESDAY, DAY 3
Leonardo da Vinci
Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) is universally recognized as one of history's
great creative geniuses. Excelling in a variety of disciplines-painting, sculpture,
architecture, music, engineering, and the physical sciences-he is often deemed
the quintessential Renaissance man.
Born in 1452 in Vinci, Italy, da Vinci was the illegitimate son of Ser Piero da
Vinci. Throughout his life he referred to himself simply as Leonardo; do Vinci
means "from Vinci" He began his artistic career in Florence as an apprentice to
the sculptor and painter Verrocchio, for whom he worked from 1470 to 1477.
Da Vinci left Florence in 1481 in order to work for Ludovico Sforza, the Duke of
Milan. During his years in Milan, he worked on a variety of projects. He
designed fortifications, made models of equestrian statues, and painted The Last
Supper. Although he never completed any of the equestrian statues, he did make
a full-scale model of one that was later smashed to bits when French troops used
it for target practice
Da Vinci returned to Florence in 1499, where he worked on a number of
paintings, most notably the Mona Lisa. Between 1513 and 1516, he resided in
Rome, lured there by the papal court. Next he moved to France, where he had
been invited to live at the estate of the French king, Francis I, who had just
recaptured Milan. He died at the Chateau of Cloux in 1519.
Although da Vinci is most famous for painting the Mona Lisa and The Last
Supper, he is also known for his voluminous sketchbooks in which he compiled
drawings and annotations on a wide range of subjects, from the physics of flight
to human anatomy. Among these is even an illustration of a fetus in the womb.
Da Vinci must have sketched it from his imagination since dissections of women
were forbidden at the time.
Due to his genius and fame, da Vinci has served as a continual inspiration for
other artists. His contemporary, Raphael, purportedly used his likeness for the
figure of Plato in the famous Vatican fresco, The School of Athens. In more
recent times, he has appeared as a character in a wide range of fiction, from the
television series Star Trek to the best-selling novel The Da Vinci Code.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. In 1999, two full-scale recreations of da Vinci's model for a huge equestrian
statue were erected, one in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the other in Milan.
2. In January 2005, a series of sealed-off rooms were discovered in a monastery
next to the church of the Santissima Annunziata in Florence. Some believe that
these were the site ofLeonardo's secret workshop.
THURSDAY, DAY 4
Earthquakes
The crust of the earth is made of several plates, fifty miles thick, which move
slowly over the earth's molten core, like ice on a frozen pond. When two plates
pull apart, collide, or rub against each other, the result is an earthquake.
Earthquakes cause approximately 10,000 deaths every year.
The point from which an earthquake originates is called the hypocenter. The
epicenter is the point on the earth's surface vertically above the hypocenter. If the
hypocenter is deep within the earth, the quake isn't likely to cause much damage.
But if the quake is shallow, it can be catastrophic. Earthquakes produce several
types of waves that shake the ground. The first are called primary waves or P-
waves. They flow longitudinally like sound waves, compressing and
decompressing the ground. They move very quickly they can travel from one
side of the world to the other in twenty minutes-but cause little damage.
The next type of wave is called an S-wave. They travel slowly and transversely,
displacing walls and fencing. The final type of wave, and by far the most
dangerous, is the L-wave. L-waves cause the ground to move up and down like
the waves in the ocean, causing landslides, fires, and tsunamis. As the earth
readjusts from an earthquake, there are several aftershockssmall tremors caused
by the ground settling into place. Buildings weakened by the original earthquake
often collapse due to aftershocks.
The intensity of an earthquake is measured on the Richter Scale. Each number
on the scale represents an increase of a factor often. A 3.0 is ten times stronger
than a 2.0 and 100 times stronger than a 1.0. Earthquakes below 4.0 usually can't
be felt on the surface. Earthquakes above 6.0 are considered strong, while
quakes above 7.0 are severe. The worst earthquakes, caused when two plates
collide with each other (which has happened in Alaska and Chile) can register
above a 9.0.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. The 1989 World Series between the OaklandAthletics and the San Francisco
Giants was interrupted by a 71 earthquake that caused a ten-day delay in the
games.
2. The explosion of volcanoes can also cause earthquakes. When Krakatoa
erupted in Indonesia in 1883, the explosion was so loud it could be heard in
Perth, Australia, 3,000 kilometers away.
3. According to a myth from India, four elephants hold up the earth. They stand
on the back ofa turtle, who balances on top ofa cobra. The movement ofany
ofthese animals starts an earthquake.
4. The indigenous people ofMozambique believe that the earth is a living
creature with the same problems as people. When it gets sick with fever and
chills, we feel it shake.
FRIDAY, DAY 5
Henry Purcell
Born into the grand tradition of royal English court music, Henry Purcell (1659-
1695) was the son of Thomas Purcell, one of the King's Musicians at
Westminster Abbey. Henry started as a choirboy at the Chapel Royal, but he
soon became a disciple of John Blow (1649-1708), who served two terms as the
organist at Westminster Abbey, and was one of the leading English composers of
the era. In 1677, Purcell became composer for the King's Violins, the royal string
band, writing his simple but beautiful Fantasias for strings.
In 1679, at age twenty, Purcell succeeded his teacher as organist at the Chapel
Royal and began composing incidental music for theater as well as church
music. In 1689, he wrote his most famous work, the opera Dido and Aeneas. At
the time, opera was not very popular in England-most composers favored the
masque, a hybrid of Italian cantatas, French secular music, and English song.
Dido and Aeneas was much smaller in scale than most modern operas. The
libretto, or text of the opera, dealt with Aeneas, a hero on his way home from the
Trojan War, who falls in love with Dido, Queen of Carthage, and then abandons
her. Purcell's version, which contrasted soloists, chorus, and instrumental dances,
required a limited number of principal singers. Several of the best-known
sections of the music were based on the idea of the ground bassa simple,
repeating theme in the lower-voiced string instruments that provides a familiar,
recognizable accompaniment to the different melodies moving above it. Purcell's
melodies are dramatic and captivating, despite the limitations of the ground bass,
and the result was a groundbreaking work for English composers.
Purcell, like Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Franz Schubert after him, died very
young, but he is regarded as one of the greatest English composers of any era,
and his work was paid tribute by later English composers such as Ralph Vaughan
Williams and Benjamin Britten.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Purcell's Dido and Aeneas was the first real opera written in the English
language. Unlike previous works, it is all music, with no stoppages for the
performers to perform a spoken part.
2. Purcellpublishedhis/i'rstpiece, a short song, at age eight.
3. Two anthems by Purcell, My Heart is Inditing and Thou Knowest, Lord, the
Secrets of our Hearts, were used at the coronation ofjames Hand the funeral of
Queen Mary, respectively.
SATURDAY, DAY 6
Epicureansism
The Epicureans were followers of a school of philosophy founded in the fourth
century BC by Epicurus (341-271 BC). They lived communally and abstained
from political activity.
The Epicureans believed all that exists are atoms and the void, or empty space.
Consequently, the soul itself is composed of atoms; it is material and dies with
the body. The Epicureans believed in gods, but they thought that the gods
would be too occupied with their own pleasures to concern themselves with
human affairs.
Like many philosophical schools in the Hellenistic world, the Epicureans
focused on the question: What is the good life? Their answer: The good life
was a life of happiness. Happiness was the presence of pleasure, and the
absence of pain. However, their psychology of pleasures and pains was unique.
The Epicureans divided pleasures into static pleasures and kinetic pleasures.
Enjoying a kinetic pleasure involves having a desire, satisfying the desire, and
then experiencing the lack of that desire. For instance, the desire for food is a
kinetic pleasure as one is hungry, eats, and then is sated. Enjoying a static
pleasure, by contrast, does not diminish your desire. Engaging in philosophical
discussion is an example of a static pleasure: The more you philosophize, the
more you want to philosophize.
While recognizing that some kinetic pleasures are necessary and good, the
Epicureans warned against those that created the desire for ever greater
quantities and varieties of stimulation. For example, a habit of consuming
delicious desserts makes it harder to take pleasure in simpler desserts, or to be
satisfied with the absence of desserts altogether. The Epicureans therefore
believed one should live mostly in an austere way, eating simple foods and
enjoying only the occasional luxury.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Contrary to what the Epicureans advocated, the word epicurean has come to
mean "devoted to the pursuit ofsensual pleasure, especially to the enjoyment
ofgood food and comfort"
2. The school Epicurus founded in Athens was known as the Garden.
3. The Roman philosopher Lucretius was an Epicurean. He wrote a long poem
about Epicurean metaphysics and natural philosophy called "On Nature. "
SUNDAY, DAY 7
The Temple and the Holy Ark
King Solomon built the first Jewish temple in Jerusalem in the tenth century BC
with three main purposes in mind: First, to be the center of the Jewish faith in
Israel. Second, to be aplace for the performance of animal sacrifices to God. And
lastly, to be a permanent home for the Ark of the Covenant, which contained the
original Ten Commandments given to Moses on Mount Sinai.
King Solomon's original temple, built during one of the wealthiest periods in
Israel's history, lasted until 586 BC, when it was destroyed by the Babylonian
ruler Nebuchadrezzar II. The Babylonians looted and destroyed the temple,
including, presumably, the Holy Ark and the Ten Commandments. With the
destruction of the temple, the Jews were exiled from the southern portion of
Israel, known as the Land of Judah.
When the Jews returned from their exile, they rebuilt the temple. This second
temple took thirtyone years to construct and was completed in 515 BC. It thrived
for five centuries. Around 19 BC, King Herod the Great began an ambitious
expansion project, which included a large retaining wall around the entire site.
The temple remained in this state until the end of the first century AD.
As the first century drew to a close, Roman-Jewish tensions rose. At the time,
one-tenth of the Roman Empire was Jewish. Moreover, many of those who were
not Jewish supported the Jews, only refraining from joining the religion because
of its circumcision requirement. Although Roman-Jewish relations were
peaceful for the most part, a group of zealots revolted in 66 AD. and Roman
leaders feared the spread of rebellion. In response, they destroyed Jerusalem and
the second temple. This was the second destruction of the Jews' holiest site, and
it began the Jewish Diaspora out of Israel.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. The site of the first two temples, the Temple Mount, regarded as the holiest
location in Judaism, is also an extremely important location for Christianity and
Islam. Islam's Dome of the Rock and Al-Agsa Mosque, both built in the sixth
century, make it the third holiest site in the Muslim faith.
2. Part of King Herod's retaining wall survived the Roman's destruction and still
exists today, known as the Western Wall or the Wailing Wall. This section ofthe
wall is a holy site that many pilgrims go to visit.

WEEK 11

MONDAY, DAY I
The Black Plague
The plague, or Black Death, killed one-third of Europe's population between
1347 and 1350. Originating in Asia, the disease spread with devastating speed.
In the squalid cities of medieval Europe, victims typically lived only a few days
after the symptoms-vomiting, diarrhea, and black tumors on the skin-first
appeared.
In many cities, the plague not only killed huge numbers but also destroyed law
and order, pushing an entire civilization to the brink of collapse. The writer
Giovanni Boccaccio, in his famous work the Decameron written in 1370-71,
described the effects of the plague in the prosperous Italian city of Florence:
"In this suffering and misery of our city, the authority of human and divine laws
almost disappeared, for, like other men, the ministers and the executors of the
laws were all dead or sick or shut up with their families, so that no duties were
carried out.... Every man was therefore able to do as he pleased."
The consequences of the plague in European society were profound. Many
enraged European Christians blamed Jews for the disease, and the pogroms that
followed the Black Death were among the worst outbreaks of anti-Semitism in
history.
Many Europeans also began to question the teachings of the Catholic Church
and the existing political order. How could God permit such a cruel disease?
Some disillusioned Europeans turned to fringe sects such as the flagellants,
named for their practice of whipping themselves. Respect for the Church, as a
result, declined. According to many historians, the plague destroyed the old
feudal order of the Middle Ages and cleared the way for the Renaissance.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Scientists continue to debate the cause of the Black Death. The leading
candidate, the bubonic plague, still exists but can be treated easily with
antibiotics.
2. Although almost everyone who was exposed to the plague in the Middle Ages
died, about5 percent ofvictims survived the epidemic, and some people were
able to avoid catching it entirely. Modern scientists believe they were protected
by a rare genetic combination thatgave them greater resistance to the germ.
3. After the Black Death, it took four centuries for Europe's population to
rebound to its pre-1347 levels.
TUESDAY, DAY 2
The Great Gatsby
Critics and readers alike have long tried to single out one work as the Great
American Novel, and thus far, most have settled on F. Scott Fitzgerald's
(18961940) The Great Gatsby (1925). Indeed, virtually no other work has
captured, and criticized, so brilliantly the essence of the American Dream.
The title character, Jay Gatsby, is a mysterious millionaire who owns a mansion
in the nouveau-riche town of West Egg, Long Island, across the harbor from old-
money East Egg. Each weekend, he throws opulent parties that draw hundreds of
"casual moths" to his estate. At one of these soirees, Gatsby meets the story's
narrator, his new neighbor Nick Carraway. Nick's immediate impression is that
Gatsby has "one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it,
that you may come across four or five times in life."
But the more Nick learns, the more cracks appear in Gatsby's facade of
perfection. Gatsby, it turns out, epitomizes the American ideal of the self-made
man-in all the wrong ways. Born into poverty in the Midwest, he earned millions
through dishonest business dealings, aided by organized crime. He changed his
name, moved east, bought the mansion at West Egg, and constructed a fake
personal history, all with the single goal of winning back his long-lost love,
Daisy Buchanan, who has since married another man.
Gatsby is a paradox on nearly every level. He lives and breathes the American
spirit of initiative, idealism, and upward mobility, but he does so entirely in
pursuit of a woman who does not merit the effort. He sets forth an image of
supreme confidence and self-assertion, but he is a lonely and lovesick man to the
core. His library is filled with books, but their pages have not been cut, so not
one of the books has even been opened.
The Great Gatsby is a scant 180 pages long, but Fitzgerald uses this brief space
masterfully and meticulously, with scarcely a wasted word. The novel is at once
a thriller, romance, mystery, and expose of the decadence of the Jazz Age. But
above all, it is Fitzgerald's prose-some of the most poetic the English language
has ever seen-that makes this quintessentially American tale unforgettable.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Fitzgerald struggled for months to settle on a title for The Great Gatsby. In
March 1925, he sent a frantic final telegram to his publisher requesting that the
title be changed to Under the Red, White, and Blue, but it was too late.
2. Fitzgerald and his wife, Zelda, were infamous figures in jazz Age society,
their tumultuous life plagued by Zelda's notorious emotional instability and
Fitzgerald's alcoholism.
3. In 1940, Fitzgerald died ofa heart attack, leaving behind the unfinished novel
The Last Tycoon, about a Hollywood movie mogul.
WEDNESDAY, DAY 3
The Last Supper
Leonardo da Vinci painted the Last Supper for his patron, Ludovico Sforza, from
1495 to 1498. Situated on the north wall of the monk's refectory at Santa Maria
delle Grazie in Milan, it is one of the most famous paintings of a biblical subject
in Western history.
The Last Supper depicts Christ celebrating the Passover meal with the twelve
apostles just before Judas betrayed him to the Romans. According to Christian
theology, this event marked the first celebration of the Eucharist, for it was at
this meal that Christ transformed the bread and wine at the table into his body
and blood.
All the figures are arranged on one side of the table, which acts as a sort of
barrier separating the sacred event from the living monks who ate their meals in
the refectory before the picture. From left to right appear the disciples
Bartholomew, James the Minor, Andrew, Peter, Judas, and John. Jesus appears in
the exact center. He is followed by Thomas, James the Major, Philip, Matthew,
Thaddeus, and Simon.
According to the sixteenth-century author Giorgio Vasari, who wrote biographies
of the most famous Italian artists of the Renaissance, Leonardo's fresco was
meant to capture the precise moment of Christ's pronouncement, "One ofyou is
about to betray me." (Matthew 26:21) The apostles are thus shown reacting to
His words, each one expressing a different emotion denial, doubt, rage, disbelief,
or love.
Another relevant passage from the Gospels is Luke 22:21, in which Christ states,
"the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table." In Leonardo's
painting, Judas is the only person besides Christ with his hand on the table. His
face is in shadow, and his body physically recoils from Jesus. In older depictions
of the scene by other artists, Judas had been depicted isolated from the rest of the
group, either seated alone on the opposite side of the table or stripped of a halo.
Leonardo distinguished him from the good apostles in a more subtle manner,
focusing on his psychological state rather than on external attributes.
The mural began deteriorating not long after it was made. Leonardo, who
worked with painstaking precision, had not used traditional fresco techniques
because these required painters to work with great speed. Instead he
experimented with an oil-and-tempera-based medium, which proved to be highly
unstable; cracks and mildew appeared within a few years. Moreover, a doorway
was cut through the wall in 1652, destroying the area where Christ's feet once
appeared. Attempts at restoration in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries had
only partial success. During World War II, the refectory was struck by a bomb
that caused further damage. In 1978, a major restoration campaign was
undertaken by the Italian government and overseen for more than twenty years
by Pinin Brambilla Barcilon. The newly restored fresco was reopened to the
public in 1999 after the refectory was equipped with climate control.
THURSDAY, DAY 4
Sunspots and Solar Flares
The volatile surface of the sun burns at 6,000 degrees Celsius, heating the entire
solar system. That's about 180 times hotter than a hot day on earth. But some
parts of the sun's surface are cooler than others. Sunspots, which are roughly the
size of our planet, appear dark in color because they are more than 2,000 degrees
cooler than the surrounding surface. They have intense magnetic fields that
choke off heat from the sun's blazing inner core.
Usually, sunspots appear in pairs, each having an opposite magnetic charge. The
areas between oppositely charged sunspots are ripe for solar flares, explosions
on the surface of the sun that release as much energy as a billion megatons of
TNT. Solar flares bombard the earth with x-rays and magnetic radiation, causing
geomagnetic storms. They intensify the Northern and Southern lights, disrupt
power grids, and mangle radio transmissions.
Sunspots and solar flares wax and wane in an eleven year cycle, the latest of
which peaked in 2000. On July 14, 2000-the so-called Bastille Day Event-an
enormous solar flare sparked dazzling auroras as far south as Texas, triggered
blackouts, and zapped satellites. Astronauts have to be wary of solar maximums
because radiation storms can be lethal. The next lull in sunspot activity should be
in 2006, when it will be safer to travel in outer space.
Sunspots may also affect the temperature on earth. Maximum sunspot activity is
associated with a slight increase in energy release from the sun, including a
dramatic rise in ultraviolet radiation. There has been an overall increase in
sunspot activity in the last sixty years, which corresponds very closely with
global warming. The mid-1600s to the early 1700s marked a low in sunspot
activity, which coincided with a period of severe cold temperatures and long
winters in Western Europe called the Little Ice Age.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Galileo Galilei used sunspots to track the rotation of the sun. Since the sun is
mostly gas, different parts of it rotate at different rates. The equator takes
roughly twenty-five days to rotate, whereas the poles take thirty-five days.
2. Chinese astronomers first observed sunspots in 30 AD.
FRIDAY, DAY 5
Johann Sebastian Bach
Bach (1685-1750) was the most important Baroque composer and perhaps the
most important composer of all time. His religious vocal music-cantatas and
chorales-his orchestral concertos, and his virtuoso organ works are filled with
sublime harmonies and contrapuntal melodies, and his overall musical
sensibilities amount to nothing short of genius. He influenced almost every
composer to come after him, including the twentieth century's purveyors of jazz
and pop.
Bach was born March 21, 1685, in the town of Eisenach, in a region called
Thuringia. As a young man, he moved around between various appointments
and sojourns in Lutheran churches in Arnstadt, Lubeck, Mulhausen, and Weimar.
The constant theme of Bach's career was that people found his music mediocre,
too complex, and unsatisfactory. Still, during his time as court organist at
Weimar (1708-1717), he rose to the rank of Konzertmeister. In 1717, he moved
to the court of Lutheran Prince Leopold at Cothen.
In 1720, Bach's first wife died, and he married a court singer named Anna
Magdalena, to whom he dedicated several books of etudes, which are now
studied by most pianists in training. During his time at Cothen, he produced
some of his famous cantatas, as well as his legendary Brandenburg Concertos
and the St. Matthew Passion oratorio. In 1722, he became director of music for
the four churches and entire city of Leipzig, where he died in 1750 just a year
after completing his monumental Mass in B minor.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Bach had six children with his first wife and thirteen with his second wife.
2. Ten of Bach's children died in their infancies, but four-including Johann
Christian Bach and Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, became well-known
composers.
3. Bach's early musical education was with his father and older brothers, but he
was a largely self-taught composer.
SATURDAY, DAY 6
Medieval Philosophy
The medieval period in Western philosophy is usually defined as lasting from the
end of Classical Antiquity, in roughly the fifth century AD, until the beginning
of the Renaissance, around the fifteenth century AD. In contrast to the bleak
track record of other disciplines during the Middle Ages, the philosophy of this
period was extremely rich, and it encompasses a number of outstanding figures.
The first major medieval philosopher was St. Augustine (354-430 AD), who
attempted to synthesize Plato's philosophy with Christianity. Augustine had a
major influence, not just on Church teachings, but upon Western philosophy and
culture as a whole.
Another important medieval figure was Boethius (480-c.525 AD), best known
now for his book The Consolation of Philosophy. However, his most important
contributions to the field were his translations of Greek philosophy into Latin.
Boethius was one of the last Western Europeans to know Greek, and after his
death, knowledge of the language disappeared from European culture for
centuries.
The early medieval period ended with two important figures: St. Anselm of
Canterbury (1033-1109) and Peter Abelard (1079-1142). Anselm is best known
for having offered the first analytic or "ontological" argument for the existence
of God, in his book Proslogion. Abelard, in addition to being a major figure in
the history of logic and semantics, is most famous for having fallen in love with
his student Heloise, with whom he fathered a child and carried on a famous
correspondence.
Later medieval philosophy has a very different character, in part due to the
rediscovery of ancient Greek texts in the thirteenth century, especially those of
Aristotle. The work of the major later medieval philosophers-St. Thomas
Aquinas (c.1224-1274), John Duns Scotus (c.1265-1308), and William of
Ockham (c.1287-1347)-was heavily influenced by Aristotle, and each of them
produced influential commentaries on individual Aristotelian works. The most
important of the three was Thomas Aquinas, who synthesized Aristotelian
philosophy and Christian theology into a grand philosophical and theological
system. Ever since, Aquinas has been a major, if not decisive, influence on
Catholic thinking.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Heloise's uncle was so outraged with his niece's affair that he had Abelard
castrated. Both Abelarad and Heloise lived the rest of their lives in religious
orders, but they carried on a correspondence, an early and moving example
ofideal romantic love.
2. Ockham is best known for the principle that bears his name, "Ockham's razor,
"usually understood to mean the simplest theory should always be preferred, or
that theories should be as simple as possible.
SUNDAY, DAY 7
Talmud
The Talmud compiles several hundred years of rabbinic commentary on the
Torah and is regarded as a central text in the Jewish religion.
The Talmud consists of two parts. The first is the Mishna. When the Torah was
originally revealed to Moses, it is believed that the written text was accompanied
by a set of oral teachings. By around 200 AD., the Jewish temples had been
destroyed and the community was the target of vicious persecution. It became
necessary to record those secondary teachings.
The second part of the Talmud is the Gemara. The Gemara consists of rabbinic
discussions of the Mishna. Whereas the Mishna contains absolute opinions, the
Gemara is written as a dialogue of differing opinions.
The Talmud most commonly referred to and used is the Babylonian, or Talmud
Bavli, compiled around 400-600 AD. A second Talmud exists, which came from
Jerusalem, but the writings in this version are more fragmented and very difficult
to understand.
The Talmud is used as a source of Halakhah, or Jewish law, and it was
commonly employed to decide disputes that arose in society. As religious and
secular laws were traditionally the same in Jewish communities, the Talmud had
a wide range of applications.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. One section of the Mishna called Pirkei Avot, "Sayings of the Fathers,"
contains famous rabbinic sayings and proverbs.
2. The Talmud is traditionally studied by the havruta method-in pairs, so students
can review and discuss each line with a partner.

WEEK 12

MONDAY, DAY I
Joan of Arc
Joan of Arc (1412-1431) was a young peasant woman who took command, at the
astonishing age of seventeen, of the medieval French armies fighting the
English. After a string of surprising victories, she was captured, convicted of
heresy, and promptly burned at the stake. Inspired by Joan's courageous
leadership, however, the French eventually drove the English off their territory.
She remains a national hero and symbol of France.
War between the kings of Europe-and especially between the English and
French-was a constant feature of medieval life. Indeed, at the time of Joan's
exploits in 1429, the two countries were in the midst of the Hundred Year's War,
a sporadic conflict that actually lasted 116 years. For the most part, war was
simply a business proposition for the greedy feudal barons who ruled Europe in
the Middle Ages. The nobles wanted land, and war was the way to get it. As a
result, national borders during the medieval period changed constantly, and the
common people of the continent, like Joan's family, felt little kinship with any
particular ruler.
But by the time of Joan's birth, that was starting to change. Joan's campaign
against the English marked one of the first examples of what would become
European nationalism. For Joan, France was not just a line on a map or the
possession of a monarch. It was her country, to which she felt a special, patriotic
bond. In visions that she experienced as a teenager, Joan claimed that God
wanted her to drive the English from France. What began as a territorial dispute
among the inbred French and English aristocracies became a clash of
nationalities. In the coming centuries, the different feudal kingdoms of Europe
evolved into nation-states with distinct cultural identities, fueling both patriotism
and its evil twin, xenophobia.
After Joan's capture in 1431, the English executed her on a trumped-up charge of
heresy. The pope later overturned her conviction, and Joan was officially made a
saint of the Catholic Church in 1920.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. During World War II, the underground fighters of the French Resistance
adopted the cross of Lorraine, Joan's emblem, as their symbol.
2. Before allowing Joan to take charge ofhis armies, the French king had his
mother-in-law examine Joan to ensure that she was a virgin. She was.
3. The nineteenth-century American author Mark Twain was fascinated by Joan
and spent twelve years researching and writing a book about the woman he
considered "easily and by far the most extraordinary person the human race has
ever produced. "Although the book is not among Twain's most well known, he
considered it one ofhis best.
TUESDAY, DAY 2
John Steinbeck
One of the best-loved American novelists of the twentieth century, John
Steinbeck (1902-1968) infused his works with the local color of his native
California. Though many critics dismissed his writing as less elegant and
groundbreaking than that of his contemporaries, he has long been a favorite
among readers. At any rate, Steinbeck's talent for crafting moving, richly
symbolic, and socially relevant stories is indisputable.
Steinbeck was born in Salinas, California, the heart of the agricultural region
between San Francisco and Monterey. After several years at Stanford
University and various stints as a manual laborer, he began writing in earnest in
the late 1920s. Steinbeck's first few efforts failed both critically and
commercially, but he finally found success with his novel Tortilla Flat (1935),
about Mexican paisanos in Monterey during the Great Depression. He followed
with the novella Of Mice and Men (1937), the heartrending story of Lenny and
George, two migrant workers on a California farm.
Steinbeck's masterpiece and most famous work is The Grapes of Wrath (1939),
his novel about a family of Dust Bowl "Okies" who flee the drought-stricken
Midwest to seek a better life in California. A desperately poor, salt-of-the-earth
clan, the toads endure great hardship during the journey but draw strength and
hope from their mutual generosity and unbreakable family ties. The novel was a
huge sensation and drew unprecedented attention to the plight of the
Depressionera poor. It has remained both a popular favorite and a staple of
English curricula ever since.
Later in his career, Steinbeck experimented ambitiously with different genres
and forms, with varying degrees of success. Best known from this era are
Cannery Row (1945), a picaresque tale of vagrants in the industrial
neighborhood of Monterey, and the sprawling East of Eden (1952), a retelling of
the book of Genesis in the setting of the Salinas Valley. Though Steinbeck
considered East of Eden his best work and it was an undeniable bestseller-critics
saw it as preachy and heavy-handed. It does, however, offer a rich, detailed
portrait of the people and history of the region, cementing Steinbeck's reputation
as California's foremost literary interpreter.
In 1962, Steinbeck received the Nobel Prize in Literature for "realistic and
imaginative writings, combining ... sympathetic humor and keen social
perception" This rather unique feat-the combination of a brutal, unflinching
depiction of poverty with an ultimately optimistic outlook-has accorded
Steinbeck an enduring place among American novelists.
ADDITIONAL FACT
1. In his Nobel Prize acceptance speech, Steinbeck asserted that any writer "who
does not passionately believe in the perfectibility of man has no dedication nor
any membership in literature."
WEDNESDAY, DAY 3
Mona Lisa
Painted circa 1505 by Leonardo da Vinci, Mona Lisa is considered the prototype
of the Renaissance female portrait. The work, which is painted in oil on a poplar
panel, measures merely thirty-one by twenty-one inches. Despite its small size
and relatively simple composition, it is one of the most famous paintings in the
world.
The identity of the woman pictured in Mona Lisa remains a mystery. According
to Giorgio Vasari, who wrote Leonardo's biography in 1550, the woman was
Lisa di Antonio Maria Gherardini (Mona is a contraction of ma donna, Italian for
"my lady"), wife of the Florentine merchant, Francesco del Giocondo. This
identification is problematic, however, since Leonardo never delivered the
painting to any patron, but kept it for himself until his death in 1519. More
recently, Dr. Lillian Schwartz of Bell Labs performed a digital comparison of the
Mona Lisa with a drawing purported to be a self-portrait of Leonardo. Based on
similarities between the two likenesses, Schwartz claimed that the painting was a
self-portrait of Leonardo in female form. This theory, too, is untenable since the
attribution of the alleged self-portrait is dubious. What seems most probable is
that the Mona Lisa is not a portrait at all, but Leonardo's image of the ideal
woman.
Regardless of the subject, the painting demonstrates Leonardo's superb use of
sfumato, that is, soft, hazy outlines that create a mysterious mood. Using this
technique Leonardo succeeded in making the woman's expression ambiguous.
Much ink has been spilled on the precise nature of Mona Lisa's smile; indeed her
demeanor seems to change depending on the angle from which she is viewed.
The Mona Lisa has had a tortured history since da Vinci's death. It was
purchased by Francis I for 4,000 gold pieces. Later it hung in Versailles and in
Napoleon Bonaparte's bedroom before finding its way into the collection of the
Louvre. In 1911, it was stolen from the Louvre only to reappear in a hotel room
in Florence two years later. After someone sprayed acid and damaged the lower
half of the Mona Lisa in 1956, the painting was hung behind a double layer of
protective glass.
THURSDAY, DAY 4
The Milgram Studies: Lessons in Obedience
In the 1960s, Stanley Milgram, a psychologist at Yale University, performed a
frightening series of experiments on obedience. Milgram demonstrated how a
situation can overpower an individual's conscience. His findings have been used
to explain the great atrocities of our time: the Holocaust, the My Lai massacre,
and the genocide in Rwanda.
Milgram drew his subjects from all walks of life, including lawyers, firemen,
and construction workers. They all agreed to accept $4.50 per hour to participate
in an experiment on learning and punishment. In the experiment, they were told
by a doctor in a white coat to act as "teachers" by reading a list of associations to
a "learner," who was out of sight but could hear in the next room. If the learner
got an association wrong, then the teacher was instructed to give them an electric
shock, increasing the voltage after each incorrect answer. The first shock was
labeled, "slight shock-15 volts." The last was labeled, "danger: severe shock-450
volts."
Of course, the real experiment was on the teachers to see how much punishment
they would administer. At 180 volts, the learner, who was an actor, would cry
out that he could not stand the pain; at 300 volts, he refused to participate; at 330
volts, there was silence. To Stanley Milgram's surprise, 65 percent of the
subjects pushed on to the end, 450 volts, even if they were told the learner had a
mild heart condition. Many of the teachers were seriously disturbed sweating
profusely, biting their lips-but with the prodding of the white-coated
experimenter, they continued in spite of their moral qualms.
Milgram's finding appalled the academic community of the 1960s, both because
of his ethically questionable methods and his gruesome results. But, his research
clearly demonstrated how ordinary people could be induced to perform
inhumane acts simply by the presence of authority. Milgram also found that the
more psychological distance the subject had from the victim, the more likely
they were to follow orders to the bitter end. If the teacher read only the questions
but did not administer the shocks, 90 percent finished the experiment. However,
if the teacher had to touch the learner in order to administer the shocks, then only
30 percent went up to 450 volts.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. The Milgram studies have been replicated in Australia, Germany, Jordan, and
other countries, all with similar results.
2. Milgram found identical rates of obedience for men and women.
FRIDAY, DAY 5
Brandenburg Concertos by Johann Sebastian Bach
These six concertos, composed while Bach was living at Cothen, were presented
as a commission to the Margrave of Brandenburg in 1721. Five of them take the
form of three movements, fast-slow-fast, and one-the first-has six movements,
including two dances. The concertos are noted for Bach's ambitious combination
of solo instruments and elegant counterpoint. The Brandenburg Concertos are
also seen as the best blend of the German baroque's imperious style and the
light-hearted gusto of composers like Antonio Vivaldi.
The first concerto-written for solo violin, three oboes, strings, bassoon, and two
hornsis driven by a dynamic dialogue between the two horns and within the
other woodwind sections. The second-for trumpet, recorder, oboe, solo violin,
and strings-makes use of all the possible soloist permutations. The third concerto
uses groups of three violins, violas, and cellos as soloists, along with the
orchestral strings. It is unusual because the soloists often play the same parts as
the orchestra behind them. The fifth concerto is for solo violin, flute,
harpsichord, and strings, and the sixth for two solo violas, low orchestral strings
(no violins), and cello. The sections in which the whole orchestra plays are
called the tutti, or "all together," and they alternate with sections in which the
solo instruments play, accompanied only by the continuo.
Brandenburg Concerto No. 4 is probably the most recognizable of the set, and it
is a quintessentially baroque piece. Written for solo violin and two recorder
solos, strings, and continuo, its fast first movement adheres very strictly to
Vivaldi's ritornello form, with its recurring tuttis and strong cadences. Its second
movement is a free-form andante, or walkingpaced movement. The final presto,
is fugal, meaning that Bach composes long themes and then imitates them in
other parts, overlapping them successively.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Before composing the Brandenburg Concertos, Bach became deeply interested
in Vivaldi and other Italian composers, and he wrote out keyboard reductions
of their orchestral pieces as an exercise to better his own work.
2. The Brandenburg Concertos are referred to as concerti grossi, or concertos
with more than one soloist.
3. Even though they were composed for Christian Ludwig, Margrave of
Brandenburg, the concertos were never played for him.
SATURDAY, DAY 6
Arguments for the Existence of God
Although many people-believers and atheists alike-argue the existence of God. It
cannot be proven. Philosophers since Aristotle have tried to do so.
There are three kinds of argument for the existence of God. The first is called
ontological, and it goes back to the medieval philosopher St. Anselm of
Canterbury (1033-1109). St. Anselm's own theory was more complicated, but the
basic outline of the ontological argument is as follows:
The second kind of argument for God's existence is the cosmological. The basic
form of the cosmological argument is to argue that there must be a first cause of
everything that exists, a cause which is itself not caused. This first cause must be
God, because nothing but God could exist without being caused. A variation on
the cosmological argument is the argument that everything except God is
contingent, in other words, it is possible for everything else not to exist. But
every contingent thing requires a cause that is itself necessary. This necessary
cause is God.
The third kind of argument is the argument from design. Not as logically strict as
the other two, according to this argument the world has features that are best
explained by the hypothesis that it was created by an intelligent designer.
Features of the world often cited include the harmony among its physical laws
that make life possible, the adaptation of organisms to their environments, and
the fact that human beings are intelligent, self-conscious beings.
ADDITIONAL FACT
1. Since Charles Darwin (1809-1882), many philosophers-but not all-have
insisted the argument from design does not work, because every feature of the
world is adequately explained by science, especially evolution.
SUNDAY, DAY 7
Kabbala
Kabbala, or Jewish mysticism, explains the many mysteries of Judaism. It seeks
to answer questions from, "Why did God create the earth and humans?" to,
"Why, if God is so good, is there evil in the world?" Kabbala tries to arrive at
mystical discoveries through the hermeneutical interpretation of Torah and
Talmud. Its purpose is to find mystical truth or ascension to God.
Central to Kabbalistic belief is the notion that God has two forms: the one in
which God manifested himself in order to create the earth and another that is
wholly unknowable. Between these two aspects of God are ten Sefirot, or
creative forces, which mediate between the unknowable God and the manifested
God. Practitioners of Kabbala believe these forces can be influenced to draw
divine powers like compassion or judgment into the world. Kabbalism also holds
that each letter in the Torah has a powerful meaning that can be deciphered.
The most important Kabbalistic text is the Sefer ha-zohar, or simply Zohar. This
work was "discovered"-more likely written-by Moses ben Shem by de Leon in
Spain during the thirteenth century. De Leon attributed the work to a second
century rabbi. This text was, as are other Kabbalistic texts, nearly
incomprehensible unless the reader already had a very strong knowledge of the
Hebrew Bible
Although Kabbala grew during the Middle Ages, its wide reach today stems
from its spread during the eighteenth century, beginning with the Hasidic
movement. Today, Kabbala has made headlines as various celebrities have
adopted its practice. However, most Kabbalistic experts, insist this version of
Kabbala, consisting of spiritual charms, stones, and necklaces, is a corruption of
the tradition's true practice.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Critics of Kabbala dislike that it identifies two aspects of God, a notion
difficult to reconcile with monotheism.
2. The red strings worn by celebrity adherents to Kabbala supposedly ward off
evil spirits.

WEEK 13

MONDAY, DAY I
The Italian Renaissance
The Italian Renaissance, which began in the city of Florence in the late
fourteenth century and peaked during the reign of a local ruler named Lorenzo
the Magnificent, was a period of tremendous political, religious, and artistic
change. The term comes from an Italian word for rebirth, and for intellectuals,
the Renaissance, indeed, felt like a rediscovery of the arts. It followed what some
regarded as a thousand-year period of cultural stagnation in Europe after the fall
of the Roman Empire.
Artists and intellectuals flocked to Lorenzo's court at the city on the Arno.
Famous painters, including Leonardo da Vinci, Botticelli, and Michelangelo,
worked in Florence. Lorenzo himself wrote poetry and hunted game.
The Renaissance marked a historical turning point, when the Middle Ages ended
and the modern era began. The Renaissance spread from the Florence of the
Medicis to other parts of Italy, and then northward to the rest of Europe. Aided
by the invention in Germany of a new kind of mass-production printing press,
the ideas of the Renaissance changed the culture of Europe profoundly.
The basic creed of the Renaissance was humanism, an intellectual movement
that replaced blind obedience to religious teachings with a return to classical
thinking. The willingness to cast aside tradition led to new forms of architecture,
painting, and scholarship. The Renaissance was, above all else, a shift in
mentality away from hidebound medieval traditions to a more inquisitive,
modern outlook on the world.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Occasionally, visitors to Florence are so overwhelmed by the magnificence
ofRenaissance art and architecture in the city that they faint-a condition
Florentines refer to as Stendhalismo, after the nineteenth-century French writer
who was reportedly unable to walk after arriving in the city.
2. Movable type, which enabled the mass production of books in Europe, was
invented by Johann Gutenberg in 1448. Prior to the invention, books had to be
hand-copied. Completing a single volume could take years or even decades.
3. The political theorist Niccold Machiavelli, who learned about politics and
governance firsthand as an adviser to the Medicis, dedicated his landmark
treatise on power The Prince to Lorenzo di Pero's son.
4. Perhaps the most famous building in Florence is the city's cathedral, which is
spacious enough to hold 30,000 worshippers. The famous eight-sided dome,
completed in 1436, was the first ofits kind ever built and is considered one of
the firstand finest examples of Renaissance architecture.
TUESDAY, DAY 2
Don Quixote
Miguel de Cervantes Don Quixote (Part I, 1605; Part II, 1615) is arguably the
most prominent cultural landmark of the Spanish-speaking world. It is celebrated
as the preeminent work of Spanish literature and widely considered the first
modern novel in any language.
The title character is a fifty-year-old man from the region of La Mancha in
central Spain. Influenced by books about chivalry, he announces one day to his
bemused family that he has changed his name to Don Quixote and that he is
going out into the world on his noble steed-really his skin-and-bones barn horse,
Rocinante- to do great deeds and right all wrongs. He enlists a "squire," an
illiterate peasant named Sancho Panza, who thinks Don Quixote is crazy but
plays along, half-believing his new master's promise that he will give Sancho an
island to govern.
The pair sets off on a long string of misadventures. Don Quixote continually
misinterprets the world around him, mistaking innkeepers for knights, prostitutes
for maidens, monks for enchanters, and windmills for giants. Often, his exploits
harm their intended beneficiaries more than they help. He dedicates all his deeds
to a "princess," Lady Dulcinea del Tobosoreally a peasant girl who is completely
indifferent to the actions being performed in her name.
Don Quixote both parodies and pays homage to the chivalric romancea genre
that was a staple of secular literature during the Middle Ages. These epic poems
told loosely connected tales of heroic knights, typically featuring themes of
courtly love. Some were based on true events, but others were purely legend. In
Don Quixote, Cervantes tackled the same subject matter, but with a more
cohesive narrative, unprecedented psychological depth, and ironic self-
awareness. He also added surprisingly postmodern twists: After another writer
published a fake sequel to the first part of Don Quixote in 1614, Cervantes
decided to write the fake sequel into the real second part of the novel. He makes
Don Quixote and Sancho aware of this false account, enabling them to comment
on it with derision.
Though we take such characteristics for granted in today's literature-and indeed
take the novel form itself for granted-they were enormous innovations at the
time. The character of Don Quixote himself is a great achievement, a figure
whom different eras and groups have variously interpreted as a buffoon, a tragic
hero, and a courageous figure refusing to conform. His embodiment of so many
qualities is precisely what has made Cervantes' protagonist one of the most
timeless characters in fiction.
ADDITIONAL FACT
1. Ofall the books published throughout history, Don Quixote is second only to
the Bible in terms of total number ofcopies printed.
WEDNESDAY, DAY 3
Albrecht Durer
Albrecht Durer (1471-1528) is one of the best-known Renaissance artists from
northern Europe. His father was a Hungarian goldsmith who settled in
Nuremberg, Germany, and taught his sons the skills to create the exquisite
engravings and wood cuts of his later career.
Durer was one of the first northern artists to travel to Italy in order to study art.
After spending time in Venice in 1494, he returned to Nuremberg, where he
combined Renaissance theory with the technique he learned in Germany.
In 1498, Durer published a cycle of fifteen woodcuts illustrating the
Apocalypse-the end of the world as described in the Book of Revelations.
Particularly famous is his portrayal of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse:
Death, Famine, War and Pestilence.
Between 1513 and 1514, he printed his three "Master Engravings." The best
known of these is Knight, Death and the Devil, depicting a medieval Christian
knight riding fearlessly through temptation and peril.
Soon after Martin Luther posted his Ninety-Five Theses in 1517, Durer became
an ardent follower ofthe Reformation. His great late masterpiece, the
FourApostles (1523-1526), includes lengthy inscriptions of Luther's German
translation of the Gospels, in which the apostles decry human error and pride.
Durer presented the painting to the city fathers of Nuremberg, a city which by
this point had embraced Lutheranism.
In his later years, Durer became increasingly interested in the theory of art. He
published a study on perspective based on the work of Piero delta Francesca in
1525. Two years later, he wrote a book on the science of fortifications. He was
working on a major treatise on proportions when he died in 1528.
Known as the "Leonardo of the North," Durer dedicated his life to harmonizing
the classical ideals of the Italian Renaissance with the naturalism of his native
Germany.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Although best known for his engravings, Diirer also excelled in watercolors as
is manifest in his Great Piece of Turf, admired today for its scientific accuracy.
2. Durer experimented with an optical device for replicating reality on a two-
dimensional surface.
3. In his engraving The Fall of Man (or Adam and Eve), Durer included four
animals to represent the four humors or temperaments: the sanguine, the
melancholic, the phlegmatic, and the irate.
THURSDAY, DAY 4
Galileo Galilei
Galileo Galilei (1565-1642), born outside of Pisa in Italy, has been called the
father of modern physics, the father of modern of astronomy, and the father of
modern science. A short list of his accomplishments includes the invention of the
compound microscope, the discovery of moons around Jupiter, designs for the
first pendulum clock, and the invention of a telescope that could see deeply into
space. His scientific experiments laid the groundwork for modern scientific
method, and his concept of inertia directly inspired Newton's laws of motion.
But probably Galileo's greatest accomplishment was the stand he took against
the Roman Catholic Church of the Renaissance. At the time, it was considered
an act of rebellion to teach that the sun was the center of the solar system, a
theory that had originated with Copernicus. In keeping with a literal
interpretation of the Bible, the theory condoned by the church was that the sun
and planets revolved around the earth. In his treatise Dialogue Concerning the
Two Chief World Systems, Galileo used the observations he made with his new
telescope to defend Copernicus. During the Inquisition, the sixty-nine-year-old
Galileo's book was banned, and he was ordered to appear before the court in
Rome. He was found guilty of defying church doctrine and sentenced to life in
prison. His sentence was commuted to house arrest, and he died eight years later
in his home near Florence, under the watch of Inquisition guards.
In 1992, 359 years after Galileo's trial, Pope John Paul II formed a commission
that recognized Galileo's bravery and formally apologized for his punishment.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Galileo's father discouraged him from studying mathematics. He wanted him
to be a doctor.
2. Galileo was also the first person to report seeing mountains and valleys on the
surface of the moon.
3. Both of Galileo's daughters were born out ofwedlock and became nuns.
FRIDAY, DAY 5
George Frideric Handel
Incorrigibly social and cosmopolitan, George Frideric Handel (1685-1759) was
the best composer, besides Johann Sebastian Bach, of the late baroque. He was
born in 1685 in the small German town of Halle to a Catholic family, and he
wrote his first two operas before the age of twenty. He then began to compose
brilliant choral pieces in Latin for the Catholic liturgy.
Between 1707 and 1711, Handel spent time in northern Italy, hobnobbing with
the great Italian composers Antonio/Arcangelo Vivaldi, Corelli, and Domenico
and Alessandro Scarlatti, whose sense of melody would have a great influence
on him. After leaving Italy to accept a post in the court of the Elector of
Hanover-who happened to be heir to the British crown-Handel convinced his
new employer to let him take a year off to travel to London. Once there, Handel
began popularizing opera to the English public. Rinaldo (1711) was the first
opera he wrote specifically for London, and though it was in Italian, it enjoyed
immense success. Many others followed, including Acis and Galatea (1718),
Radamisto (1720), and Giulio Cesare (1724). These works made him the king of
the newly opened Royal Academy of Music, where the finest operas in England
were being staged.
When the Elector of Hanover finally arrived in London in 1717 to take the
crown as George I, Handel was concerned the new monarch would be angry that
he had spent more time in London than back in Hanover. According to one
legend, Handel composed the famous Water Music suite to win back the king's
favor; when the king heard how brilliant Handel's music had become, he doubled
his salary.
During Handel's later years in England, he shifted his focus from opera to
oratorio, a dramatic but unstaged genre for soloists, chorus, and orchestra,
usually religious in content. He completed more than thirty before he died. He
wrote his beloved Messiah (1742), followed by Samson (1743), Semele (1744),
Solomon (1749), and others. He died in London in 1759.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Handel's father originally wanted him to be a lawyer, nota musician.
2. Handel's Messiah oratorio is performed each year at Christmas at countless
churches worldwide.
3. Handel's first opera in England, Rinaldo, featured live sparrows being released
during a scene that took place in the woods.
SATURDAY, DAY 6
Skepticism
"Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real? What if you
were unable to wake from that dream? How would you know the difference
between the dream world and the real world?"
-Morpheus, The Matrix
Are you living in a computer simulation? How do you know? It seems like you
are holding a real book, made of real paper. But how do you know that isn't
because a computer is telling your brain to have the experience of holding a
book, made of real paper? How do you know that any of your experiences about
the world are worth trusting?
This dilemma is known as the problem of skepticism about the external world.
Skepticism, more generally, is any set of philosophical arguments or claims
intended to undermine our belief in some alleged body of knowledge. A skeptic
is someone who uses skeptical arguments to undermine our ordinary claims of
knowledge.
Here's another form of skepticism: How do you know that other people have
thoughts, feelings, and experiences? They act as though they have thoughts.
And if you ask them, they will say they have experiences. But how do you
know they are telling the truth? Any evidence that tries to support the claim that
other people are thinking beings can be reinterpreted to suggest that they are
very elaborately programmed robots.
Many philosophers have claimed to have resolved the problem of skepticism
about the external world and other minds. Still others have admitted defeat.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Rend Descartes (1596-1650) wrote the most famous and influential
presentation of skepticism in his Meditations on First Philosophy, in which he
considers thepossibility that a very powerful, but malevolent, demon has
created him and is systematically deceiving him. Descartes asked his reader,
how do I know that I am not being deceived by such a demon?
2. While Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) regarded it as a great "scandal" that
philosophy had not yet solved the problem of skepticism, Martin Heidegger
wrote that thegreat scandal was not that the problem was not solved, but that
philosophers thought that it stood in need ofd solution.
SUNDAY, DAY 7
Hasidism
The Hasidic movement was founded by Rabbi Israel ben Eliezer, known as the
Besht, or Baal Shem Tov, in the mid-eighteenth century.
The core beliefs of Hasidism are pantheism and devekut. Pantheism holds that
God is present in all natural physical objects. This caused great unrest among
Jews as it conflicted with the widely held belief that God did not have any
physical presence. Devukot is a state of ecstatic communion with God, open to
every Hasid.
Traveling through Poland and the Ukraine, the Besht emphasized that emotional
communion with God and love of fellow Jews was more important than
technical Torah scholarship. He placed a great stress on heartfelt prayer, as
opposed to study.
In the eighteenth century, Hasidism quickly spread throughout Eastern Europe,
encountering opposition to its beliefs wherever it went. Still, various sects were
formed, as groups adhered to the specific teachings of certain rebbes, or spiritual
leaders. The movement thrived until World War II and the Holocaust. With much
of their population executed, and their homes and towns destroyed, Hasidic Jews
mostly emigrated to either Israel or the United States.
Today Hasids are often most strongly identified with their manner of dress.
While specific attire differs from sect to sect, most Hasidic men wear a long
black coat, prayer belt, black hat, and a set ofwhite threads, called tzitzit,
hanging outside their clothes at the waist. Additionally, men are not allowed to
shave the sides of their faces, which is why many Hasidic Jews wear curls,
called payot, and beards. The requirements for Hasidic women are less uniform
but quite severe. They are required to wear conservative skirts and long sleeves,
and married women must cover their hair.
Hasidic Jews chose this manner of dress to preserve as many of their customs as
they could from the eighteenth century. They also believe it is important to stand
out from secular society and look Jewish. Thus, a group that was once radical, is
today seen as quite conservative.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. The word Hasidism can also be used to refer to a group ofjews during the
third century BC. These Hasidic Jews were conservative and opposed
Hellenistic Jews who advocated assimilation.
2. Not all Hasidic sects get along. The Satmer sect is anti-Zionist while the
Chabad sect supports the State ofIsrael.

WEEK 14

MONDAY, DAY I
The Reconquista
Almost as soon as the Muslim caliphate conquered Spain in 718 AD, Christian
Europe began plotting to win the peninsula back. It took almost 800 years of
sporadic war but the reconquista was ultimately successful in 1492, when the
last stronghold of Moorish control on the peninsula, the great fortress of
Granada, fell to the Spanish monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella. But the Moors, as
Spain's Muslims were called, left a strong cultural legacy to the modern nations
of Spain and Portugal.
During the eight centuries of Moorish rule, the Iberian Peninsula was known as
al-Andalus. The caliphate was the only extended period of Islamic rule in
otherwise Christian Western Europe. Muslim Spain was, by many measures, a
stunning success. The architectural marvels built by the caliphs rivaled their
Christian counterparts at the time.
Christian Europe was both fascinated and terrified by the Moors in their
backyard. Retaking Iberia became a key goal for medieval Christians and a
rallying cry for the Church. Charlemagne, among other European kings, sent his
troops to fight the Moors. The Crusades, though aimed at Muslim-held territories
in the Middle East, were influenced by the friction between Christians and
Muslims generated by Moorish control of Spain.
The cities under Moorish control began to fall to Christian armies after 1100 AD.
Christians captured Zaragossa in 1118. Lisbon, the capital of modern-day
Portugal, fell in 1147. The great Moorish capital, Cordoba, was captured in
1236. The fall of Granada in 1492 completed the reconquista. The conquering
Christians were not nearly as tolerant as the Moors. A few months after the fall
of Granada, Jews were expelled from Spain. A few years later, the remaining
Muslims on the peninsula were ordered either to convert or leave Iberia. The
once-thriving caliphate had vanished, but Spain and Portugal, two countries that
were soon to become major players on the world stage, had emerged from the
ruins.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. In 1294, with the boundaries between Portugal and Spain still unsettled,
Portugal signed a treaty of alliance with England. It is the oldest treaty in the
world still in force.
2. One of the most famous warriors of the reconquista period was a Christian
general named El Cid, who actually fought for both Christians and Muslims.
3. The Koran forbade depicting human figures in mosques, which lead to a
reliance on geometric forms and patterns. This distinctive architectural style
remains visible in many Spanish towns where mosques were converted into
Catholic churches after the reconquista.
TUESDAY, DAY 2
The Canterbury Tales
Though details about Geoffrey Chaucer's life are elusive, the legacy of his
magnum opus, The Canterbury Tales (c. 1390s), is clear. It played a central role
in establishing English as a literary language, a real alternative to the French and
Latin that were standard-even in England-at the time. By upending the notion
that English was inherently inferior to classical languages, Chaucer paved the
way for Edmund Spenser, Sir Philip Sidney, Christopher Marlowe, William
Shakespeare, and other subsequent giants of English literature.
The Canterbury Tales is a set of twenty-four stories told by various pilgrims who
are journeying in a group from the London area to Canterbury to visit the shrine
of St. Thomas a Becket. The prologue suggests that Chaucer originally intended
to include 120 tales, but it is uncertain whether the work is incomplete or
whether Chaucer simply changed his mind and chose to stop at twenty-four.
Chaucer's pilgrims are a hodgepodge of people from different walks of life: the
Knight, the Miller, the Pardoner, the Prioress, the Wife of Bath, and so on. Their
tales cover a range of literary genres, from sermon to allegory, from hagiography
to chivalric romance. The subject matter of the tales also varies widely, from
courtly love to religious hypocrisy to episodes of bawdy humor.
The language of The Canterbury Tales is Middle English, the bridge between the
Old English of Beowulf and the modern English in use today. Though spelling,
pronunciation, and word order have changed significantly since Chaucer's time,
much of his language is accessible to present-day readers. For instance, the Wife
of Bath's tale opens with this description of the supernatural beings who
allegedly populated Arthurian England:
All but two of the tales are in verse. Chaucer chose to depart from prevailing
French verse forms and use iambic pentametera ten-syllable-per-line form that
has since become a staple of English poetry. This momentous decision on
Chaucer's part set the stage for Shakespeare and others to apply iambic
pentameter brilliantly in plays and sonnets during the centuries that followed.
ADDITIONAL FACT
1. After the Black Death ravaged England in the late 1340s, Chaucer's family
inherited a fortune from relatives who died in the epidemic. This financial
windfall enabled Chaucer to obtain an education rather than become a
tradesman or merchant.
WEDNESDAY, DAY 3
Michelangelo
Michelangelo (1475-1564) is often regarded as the greatest artist of the Italian
High Renaissance. A gifted painter, architect, poet, and engineer, he considered
himself first and foremost a sculptor. Giorgio Vasari, who knew Michelangelo
personally and wrote his biography, claimed that he could breathe life into
inanimate marble.
Michelangelo was born in 1475 in the town of Caprese in Tuscany. An
exceptionally talented youth, he was invited to join the intellectual and artistic
circle surrounding the wealthy scion of the Medici family, Lorenzo the
Magnificent. From Florence he went to Rome, where he received a commission
to sculpt a Pieta (an image of the Virgin lamenting the dead body of her son),
which he completed in 1499.
By 1501, Michelangelo had returned to Florence where he worked on his famous
sculpture of David. Called back to Rome several years later, he was asked to
design and execute an elaborate monument with forty larger than life-sized
figures for the tomb of Pope Julius II. This project was soon interrupted by
another request from the pope, who wished Michelangelo to paint the entire
ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. The young artist, who had little experience
working in fresco, completed the task in a mere four years.
Once the ceiling was done, Michelangelo returned to the pope's tomb for which
he carved the figure of Moses and The Dying Slave between 1513 and 1516.
Since Julius II died before his tomb was ready and his family was reluctant to
pay for such an extravagant monument, Michelangelo was unable to finish the
commission to his own design. Disappointed, he spent much of the next twenty
years working on various projects for the powerful Medici family, most notably
their funerary chapel in the basilica of San Lorenzo.
In 1534, Michelangelo returned to Rome to paint a fresco of the Last Judgment
on the altar wall of the Sistine. He signed the work by painting his own likeness
onto the flayed skin of the martyr Bartholomew. Several years after
Michelangelo completed the painting, Pope Paul IV had the nudes in the Last
Judgment covered with drapery, as he considered them offensive. Most of the
drapery was left intact in the recent restoration of the chapel.
Michelangelo also made his mark on the urban planning of Renaissance Rome.
In 1537, he was asked to redesign the space atop the Capitoline Hill, the ancient
center of the city. Nine years later, he was appointed chief architect of new Saint
Peter's, for which he designed the famous dome. Unfortunately he did not live to
see its completion. He died in Rome at the age of eighty-four.
ADDITIONAL FACT
1. In the Creation of Adam in the Sistine Chapel, Michelangelo portrayed God
within an oval created by airborne angels. Two Brazilian doctors, Gilson
Barrens andMarcelo de Oliviera, recently suggested that the artist consciously
based the composition on the oval cross section ofthe human brain.
THURSDAY, DAY 4
Static Electricity
Why does your hair sometimes stand up after you comb it? Why do door handles
sometimes shock your hand after you put on your coat in winter? The answer is
static electricity.
All matter consists of atoms. Each atom is made of neutrons, protons, and
electrons. Neutrons have no charge; protons are positively charged; and electrons
are negatively charged. Protons and neutrons are tightly bound together in the
center of the atom, called the nucleus, while the electrons orbit around them, like
planets orbiting around the sun. When there are just as many protons as
electrons, the atom has no charge. But sometimes, electrons rub off onto other
atoms. The atoms that gain electrons become negatively charged; the atoms that
lose electrons become positively charged. Atoms with opposite charges are
attracted to each other or a neutrally charged object. Atoms with the same charge
are repulsed by each other.
This is why your hair stands up on end. The electrons from your hair rub off onto
your brush. Your hair becomes positively charged. Each positive strand of hair
wants to move as far away from the other strands as possible, so you get "fly-
away" hair.
Some materials, like metals, grab electrons and let them flow freely through
them. These are called conductors. Other materials, like plastic and fabric, are
more rigid and stop electrons from moving. These are called insulators. When
you put on your coat in winter, electrons from your coat rub off onto you. You
become negatively charged. When you touch a metal door handle, the electrons
jump from your hand to the metal knob, a good conductor. This heats the air,
creating a spark. This is more likely to happen in winter because the air is dry.
Moisture in the air absorbs electrons (water is a good conductor), deadening the
spark.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Lightning is static electricity on a larger scale. During a storm, the movement
of electrons creates positive charges at the tops of clouds and negative charges
at the bottoms. Usually, electrons will jump from one cloud to another to
equalize the charge, but sometimes they jump to the neutrally charged ground
in a lightning bolt.
2. Benjamin Franklin discovered that lightning is static electricity in his famous
kite experiment.
3. Franklin also invented the lightning rod, a device that arguably has saved
more lives than any other in history.
FRIDAY, DAY 5
Handel's Messiah
In 1741, George Frideric Handel received a commission from the Viceroy of
Ireland to compose a piece for a Dublin charity concert. For twenty-four days
starting on August 22, Handel worked at a furious pace on what would become
his most famous piece, the oratorio Messiah. Although Handel was already
famous in London, his composition of Messiah ensured that the composer would
be a household name for generations to come. Even today, choirs across the
world perform the piece to celebrate the Christmas season.
The oratorio genre originated in the seventeenth century, and its name comes
from the prayer halls that were attached to sixteenth and seventeenth-century
Catholic churches, halls in which these pieces were originally performed,
theaters being closed during penitential seasons. Oratorios are choral/orchestral
works that alternate between solo parts and choruses and are almost always set
to narrative texts with characters and plot lines. They are like operas without the
theatrical staging-performed in halls without costumes or on-stage action.
Unlike most oratorios, Messiah does not have a linear plotline. It is a
disconnected series of meditations on Christ and recitations of biblical
prophecies. The content was unusual for Handel, a largely secular composer. The
famous Hallelujah chorus is one of the best known Baroque pieces, as are the
choruses titled "O we, like sheep, have gone astray," and "For unto us a child is
born" After its triumphant premiere in Dublin in 1742, Handel's fame
skyrocketed, solidifying his career as a commercial composer. He never quite
equaled Messiah, the most famous oratorio ever written, but he finished his
career in London assured his name would go down in history.
ADDITIONAL FACT
1. The speed with which Handel completedMessiah has led some to believe
thathe was truly divinely inspired. Other accounts say that Handel always
worked faster than the average composer, and that Messiah was no exception.
SATURDAY, DAY 6
Rene Descartes
Born in 1596 in La Haye, France, Rene Descartes (1596-1650) worked for
several years as a military engineer before writing revolutionary works in
philosophy, mathematics, and science. He died in 1650.
Descartes' philosophical project was to replace the Aristotelian system of science
that was then the basis of university education in France and throughout Europe.
His most famous work was his Meditations on First Philosophy. The book
recounted his thoughts over six days spent in a small room during his travels.
Descartes attempted to question all ofhis beliefs and retain only those whose
truth he could not doubt. It was during this effort that Descartes made his famous
observation that because he could not doubt he thinks, he could not doubt he
exists-"I think therefore I am" or, in the original Latin, "Cogito ergo sum."
While Descartes concluded his fundamental existence was not in doubt, he
believed he could doubt the nature of his body. Because his ability to think was
irrefutable but the existence of his physical body was not, Descartes argued mind
and body are distinct.
Descartes believed bodies were described by physics. They are geometrical
things in motion with size, shape, and velocity. Minds, on the other hand, are
immaterial thinking things. Hence, for Descartes, animals were mere machines.
Because they do not think (he assumed), they do not have minds, and they must
simply be complex arrangements of moving parts.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Descartes called bodies "res extensa"-extended things-and minds "res
intelligens"-thinking things.
2. Descartes invented coordinate geometry.
SUNDAY, DAY 7
Jesus Christ
Jesus of Nazareth was born and raised a Jew during the period of the Roman
Empire. Christians believe he was the son of God and the long-awaited Messiah.
The Four Canonical Gospels tell the story of his life.
Jesus was born in Bethlehem to Mary, who Christians believe was a virgin
impregnated by the Holy Ghost. Mary's husband, Joseph, is rarely mentioned in
the Gospels and therefore is believed to have died before Jesus reached his
middle-teen years. Jesus adopted Joseph's trade, carpentry, before beginning to
teach when he reached his thirties.
Jesus taught through short stories, parables, paradoxes, and metaphors. Some
of his most famous teachings are the Sermon on the Mount and the parable of
the Good Samaritan. Additionally, he performed miracles, healing the sick and
even resurrecting the dead. He befriended and taught women, which was
condemned by the religious establishment of the time.
Throughout his teachings, Jesus emphasized the coming of the Kingdom of
Heaven, as well as the forgiveness of sin. The meaning of this has been
interpreted in several ways. Some, because Israel was occupied by the Romans,
believed that Jesus was speaking of political freedom. More common, however,
was the belief that Jesus was preaching about the end of the world. This
apocalyptic end was thought to be the coming of the Messianic age described in
the Torah. Jesus was believed to be the Messiah, or savior, promised by the Old
Testament, who would usher in an era of redemption and harmony.
Although Jesus had many followers, he regularly challenged the status quo. In
order to demonstrate his displeasure with the Jewish elders of Israel, he created a
disturbance at the Temple during Passover. The Sanhedrin, the Jewish high
court, convicted him of blasphemy and handed him to the Romans on the charge
of sedition against the State. The Roman leader in Israel, prefect Pontius Pilate,
sentenced Jesus to be executed by crucifixion. Three days after his burial,
however, Christians believe Jesus was resurrected from his tomb, proving his
godliness before ascending to Heaven.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. In 532, then known as the 248th year ofthe Diocletian Era, Dionysius Exiguus
attempted to determine the date of jesus's birth. After much study, he
determined the exact year and re-dated it December 25, 1 AD, establishing the
western calendar still in use today. However, that calendar is based on a
miscalculation. It is now believed Jesus was born four to eightyears before year
1.
2. Christ is the Greek term for "messiah."

WEEK 15

MONDAY, DAY I
The Inquisition
In the century after 1492, Spain became the most powerful country in the world.
Spanish conquistadors captured vast territories in the New World, from Peru to
Cuba. Galleons laden with gold and other riches returned to Spanish ports,
instantly making the crown wealthy almost beyond comprehension. Spanish
armies also controlled other parts of Western Europe, including modern-day
Belgium and the Netherlands.
Within Spain's borders, a domestic campaign for religious purity gained steam.
After expelling the Jews in 1492 and ordering Muslims to convert to
Christianity, the authorities in Madrid were determined to turn their newly
powerful country into a pious Christian kingdom. Many Spanish churchmen
feared that Jewish and Muslim converts to Christianity still practiced their old
faith in secret, threatening the religious unity of Spain.
The Spanish Inquisition aimed to root out heresy and punish the so-called "false
converts," often with a grisly execution. Other countries in Catholic Europe
conducted inquisitions, but Spain's was notorious for its length and severity; the
last execution for heresy carried out by the Inquisition-by strangulation-was in
1826.
Today, the Spanish Inquisition is synonymous with the overzealous religious
persecutions and bigotry of the medieval period. It particularly targeted Jews,
fueling European anti-Semitism. However, Spain was not alone. Religiously
inspired violence was a constant feature of the Middle Ages, across the
continent. In Britain, thousands were executed as witches, a practice that only
ended gradually with the Enlightenment, when progressive thinkers began to
reject a literal interpretation of the Bible.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Jews were not officially allowed to return to Spain until 1858.
2. The Roman Inquisition also murdered and imprisoned scientists, like Galileo,
whose findings contradicted Church belief
TUESDAY, DAY 2
The Divine Comedy
The Divine Comedy is the masterpiece of the Italian poet and philosopher Dante
Alighieri (1265-1321). A detailed account of a man's journey through the
afterlife, it has influenced Christian cosmology for centuries and formed the
basis of the modern Italian language.
Born in Florence, Dante was active in the city's public life. In 1302, he fled into
exile after his political stances earned him a death sentence from the Florentine
government. It was in this exile that he wrote La Commedia, as he himself titled
the poem. The moniker La Divina Commedia came into use only after Dante's
death.
La Commedia is structured in threes, mirroring the Christian concept of the Holy
Trinity. It includes three sections-Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso-each
comprised of thirty-three divisions, or cantos. One additional canto, a prologue,
brings the total to 100. Even the poem's internal structure is based on threes:
Dante wrote the entire work in terza rima, a form in which sets of three lines are
joined in an interlocking rhyme scheme (ABA, BCB, CDC, etc.).
The protagonist of La Commedia is Dante himself. Lamenting his loss of
direction in life, he encounters the spirit of the Roman poet Virgil in a forest.
Virgil guides him to the gates of hell, which bear the legendary inscription
Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate-"Abandon all hope, ye who enter." Passing
through the nine circles of hell, Dante sees damned souls suffering a host of
eternal punishments. These terrifying images in Inferno culminate in the
appearance of Satan himself, trapped in a lake of ice at the very bottom of hell.
In Purgatorio, Dante visits purgatory, the holding ground for souls not yet pure
enough to meet God. After this stage, Virgil can go no further, for as a pagan he
cannot enter heaven. Dante receives a new guide, Beatrice, who embodies divine
grace in a figure of romantic love. After ascending the nine levels of heaven in
Paradise, Dante briefly sees God, culminating a journey that has mirrored that of
the human soul on the path to God-from sin through repentance into salvation.
La Commedia had an enormous effect on the development of the Italian
language. Virtually all Italian literature until the 1200s had been written in Latin,
so Dante's decision to use vernacular Italian was a significant change. When the
Italian city-states became a unified nation in 1861, the Tuscan dialect used in the
works of Dante was established as the standard for written Italian, still in use
today.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. The poet T. S. Eliot wrote, "Dante and Shakespeare divide the modern world
between them; there is no third."

WEDNESDAY, DAY 3
David
In 1501 the republic of Florence hired Michelangelo to sculpt a figure of David
for the facade of its cathedral. The Old Testament king-a heroic warrior who had
vanquished the giant Goliath in his youth-was commonly regarded as the
protector of the Tuscan city. The commission had initially been granted to
another artist who died shortly after blocking out a huge piece of expensive
marble. According to legend, Michelangelo received the job because he was the
only one willing to work with the "spoiled" stone. When Michelangelo
completed the figure in 1504, it was considered too extraordinary to be placed
high up on the church. Instead, it was placed before the Palazzo Vecchio on the
Piazza della Signoria in the very center of Florence.
The scupture, one of the superb masterpieces of the High Renaissance, captures
a tense David right before he attacks Goliath. This is not the victorious youth of
Donatello's famous rendering, but an adolescent poised for action. Inspired by
classical models, Michelangelo carved a beautiful, athletic body standing with
his weight on one leg and his noble head turned to the left. David's muscles
bulge with gathering power as he prepares to slay the giant. His over-sized hands
and feet suggest both the distorted proportions typical of adolescents and the
promise of future strength.
According to an anecdote published by Michelangelo's biographer Giorgio
Vasari, a Florentine citizen, Pietro Soderini, complained that David's nose was
too large. Responding to the critique, Michelangelo pretended to chip away at
the nose. When the sculptor was done, Soderini exclaimed, "Now you have
given it life!"
The sculpture was pelted with stones when it was first erected on the Piazza
della Signoria, probably by supporters of the exiled Medici clan who saw the
figure as a symbol of the republic. In 1527, its left arm was broken during a riot.
The statue was removed from the Piazza in 1873 in order to rescue it from
damage caused by the elements and pollution. Once it was safely enclosed in the
Academy of Fine Arts, a copy was installed in its place. In 1991, a deranged
Italian painter attacked the original with a hammer, smashing one of its toes.
The statue was cleaned with distilled water in anticipation of its 5001h birthday,
Plans for installing a permanent jet stream to prevent further dirt buildup are
currently being discussed.
Today the David can be seen in the Galleria dell'Accademia along with other
sculptures by Michelangelo, such as the four unfinished slaves that he designed
for the tomb of Julius II.
THURSDAY, DAY 4
The Ozone Layer
The earth's atmosphere is divided into several layers. Humans live in the
troposphere, an oxygen-rich environment that extends just above the peak of
Mount Everest. The next layer, ten to fifty kilometers above the surface of the
earth, is called the stratosphere. It contains 90 percent of the world's ozone (0),
an important molecule that makes human life on the surface possible. The ozone
layer refers to the part of the stratosphere with the highest concentration of
ozone, an area approximately twenty-five kilometers above sea level.
Ozone is a rare molecule. It contains three oxygen atoms, whereas normal
oxygen molecules (02) contain only two. For every two million oxygen
molecules, there are only three ozone molecules. But the ozone layer absorbs 97
to 99 percent of the harmful ultraviolet (UV) light that comes from the sun. UV
radiation causes cataracts, sunburns, and skin cancer. It also damages crops and
marine life.
Ozone absorbs UV radiation in a self-perpetuating cycle. When ultraviolet
radiation hits an ozone molecule, it splits into an oxygen molecule (02) and an
unstable single oxygen atom. The single oxygen atom quickly binds to an
oxygen molecule, forming another ozone molecule. Unfortunately, certain man-
made organohalogen compounds can interfere with this highly efficient process
when they are released into the atmosphere. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are the
most famous.
When CFCs were invented half a century ago, they were thought to be miracle
compounds. They were stable, cheap, nontoxic substances that could be used as
refrigerants, propellants in sprays, cleaners for electronics, and sterilizers in
hospitals. By 1988, more than 320,000 metric tons of CFCs had been used
worldwide. In fact, CFCs are so stable that they can survive for over 200 years in
the atmosphere. When CFCs reach the stratosphere, ultraviolet radiation breaks
down the molecules. This releases chlorine, which binds to ozone, destroying it.
A single chlorine atom can destroy 100,000 ozone molecules. The depletion of
the ozone layer in the last half of the twentieth century lead to the 1987 Montreal
Protocol, which officially banned the use of CFCs in developed countries.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. A "hole"in the ozone layer has appeared over Antarctica every spring since the
early 1980s. Its not literally a hole but rather a thinning of up to 60 percent
during the worst years.
2. Although the ozone layer is still markedly thinner than it was fifty years ago,
recent scientific reports suggest that it is on the mend and could be restored by
the end of the century.
3. The chlorine from swimming pools, sea salt, and volcanoes cannot reach the
stratosphere.
FRIDAY, DAYS
Musical Genres
Historically, music has been written and performed to fit particular social
occasions. Before the 1700s, music served one of three functions: chamber
music (played by small ensembles in the salons and drawing rooms of the
aristocracy), church music (masses, motets, anthems, and hymns), or theater
music (incidental music played between acts of a play, or opera).
Over the years, several standard genres, used by many composers, have
developed. There are, of course, more musical genres, but these are the ones in
which composers have established themselves as great talents:
BALLET: Ballet d'action, a style of public dance performance that was dominant
in Paris by the eighteenth century, was an outgrowth of the north Italian courtly
dances of the fourteenth century.
CHAMBER MUSIC: During and after the classical era, Viennese masters like
Franz Joseph Haydn, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and Ludwig van Beethoven
set the standard for how chamber music should sound, its structure, and the
ensembles it should utilize-string quartet, piano trio, small wind ensembles, etc.
CONCERTO: From the Italian concertare, or "coming together," concerto
literally refers to a group of instruments playing in unison, but in the baroque
period, this came to mean an orchestra accompanying one or many solo
instruments, trading the main themes of the composition back and forth.
OPERA: This genre is a combination of theatrical staging, passionate singing,
orchestral music, and oft-poetic librettos (scripts) put together to tell a story. It is
distinct from oratorio in that it is actually acted out on a stage, but different from
theater because the lines and the narrative are delivered entirely in song.
SUITE: Multi-movement works that incorporate dances or other short
instrumental types or that are arranged to tell a programmatic story.
SYMPHONY: A multi-movement piece for full orchestra, the symphony has its
roots in the concerto ripieno, a late baroque style of concerto-writing that used
the entire ensemble, rather than just one or a few soloists, as the main melodic
voice.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Some of the most famous concertos are Bach'sBrandenburg Concertos,
Mozart's concertosforFrenchhorn, and Sergey Rachmaninoff's complex
Concerto No. 3 for piano.
2. Other genres include the multiple forms ofchurch music (liturgical music,
anthems, hymns, and chorales) and salon music, such as Frederic Chopin's
Nocturnes or Franz Schubert's Lieder, both of which were written to be
performed as entertainments at social gatherings or at the piano in a private
residence.
SATURDAY, DAY 6
Cogito, Ergo Sum
Possibly the most famous sentence in philosophy, Rene Descartes's "cogito, ergo
sum"-I think therefore I am-appears in his work Discourse on Method.
Descartes's famous conclusion came at the end of a project to subject all of his
beliefs to radical doubt. In other words, Descartes set out to reject any belief he
could not know for certain to be true. For instance, he rejected his belief in the
world of sensory experience because he believed his senses could be deceived.
However, he found one belief he could not doubt-that he was thinking. Descartes
claimed it was impossible for him to doubt that he was thinking, because in
doubting this, he would be thinking. Then Descartes declared, if he knew for
certain that he was thinking, he knew for certain that he existed. Thus, Descartes
had found one unquestionable belief beliefin his own existence.
Descartes's cogito argument is a common jumping-off point for what
philosophers call the problem of self-knowledge: What is unique about our
awareness of ourselves from the inside? That is, in what ways is it different to
think about our own thoughts, feelings, and desires as opposed to anything else?
Some people think one difference is that we cannot be mistaken when we
honestly report what we are thinking or feeling. This idea seems plausible if you
consider the case of pain. Ifyou feel that you are in pain, it seems impossible that
you could be wrong in believing that you are in pain.
ADDITIONAL FACT
1. Descartes believed that he hadgiven a proof for the existence of God that was
so strong it could not possibly be doubted.
SUNDAY, DAY 7
Sermon on the Mount
This famous sermon, delivered on a mountainside in Galilee by Jesus around 30
AD, and recounted in the Gospel of Matthew, is the central expression of his
teachings.
During this sermon, Jesus called upon his followers to be even more righteous
than the Ten Commandments demanded. He explained that obeying the Ten
Commandments alone was not good enough for salvation. Not only can one not
kill, but one cannot have angry thoughts; not only can one not commit adultery,
but one cannot have lustful thoughts; not only can one not steal, but one cannot
have thoughts about one's material needs. Jesus called for his followers to obey
only the teachings of God and not the teachings of rabbis, as God was the only
one perfect enough to enlighten.
Moreover, it is in this sermon that Jesus asked his audience to "turn the other
cheek" and submit to more punishment, instead of following the retaliatory, Old
Testament concept of "an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth." Similarly, Jesus
also asked that they peacefully "resist not evil."
Interpreting this sermon has proven very difficult. It seems that Jesus has set the
bar for salvation too high for even his most devout followers to achieve.
Nevertheless, some absolutists suggest that in order to reach salvation, the
sermon must be followed line by line. Others suggest Jesus was speaking in
hyperbole and that, in real-world application, these doctrines were guidelines
that would have to be modified.
Albert Schweitzer claimed that because Jesus believed the end of the world was
imminent, survival-which would be difficult to achieve if doctrines such as
"resist no evil" were followed to the letter-was unimportant. Another approach
holds that Jesus's followers were expected to fail in obeying his guidelines, but
therefore they would learn to repent.
Despite these varied interpretations, the sermon remains a major source of
Christian belief.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. It is widely debated whether the Sermon on the Mount as depicted in the
Gospel ofMatthew is actually one sermon or a series ofjesus's beliefs taken from
other, shorter sermons, that Matthew compiled into one.
2. The sermon also includes the Golden Rule, the Lord's Prayer, and famous
sayings such as, `Judge not, that ye not be judged."

WEEK 16

MONDAY, DAY I
Martin Luther
I cannot andI will not recant anything, fortogo against
conscience is neither right nor safe."
-Martin Luther
By 1500 AD, nearly all of Europe embraced Christianity. While the individual
kingdoms of medieval Europe often bickered and fought, they all worshipped the
same God. After the collapse of the Roman Empire in the fifth century, the
spread of Christianity accelerated, eventually reaching France, England,
Germany, Russia, and Scandinavia. Medieval Christendom-the community of
believers-stretched from the olive groves of Italy to the fjords of Iceland.
But this unity masked growing unhappiness with the church during the Middle
Ages. The horrors of the plague left many Europeans disillusioned, as many
could not understand why God would allow so many to die. The Renaissance
challenged traditional Christian teachings. And the venality and corruption of the
Roman Catholic Church itself dismayed many of its most ardent believers.
In 1517, a frustrated German clergyman named Martin Luther tacked a
document to the doors of the cathedral in Wittenberg. The document contained
Luther's Ninety-Five Theses, a scathing indictment of the pope's leadership and
the general state of the Roman Catholic Church.
Luther's main accusation was that the church leadership in Rome had become
too greedy and decadent. At the time, the pope was selling indulgences to rich
laymen to fund the construction of new cathedrals. An indulgence officially
forgave its buyer for his sins. The practice of selling forgiveness to the highest
bidder deeply offended Luther.
Almost immediately, Luther's theses provoked a major schism within European
Christianity. In many corners ofEurope, his criticisms of the church found a
receptive audience. Luther's followers became Protestants, rejecting the
traditional authority of the pope in a religious movement known as the
Reformation. Within a few years, England and many other pockets of northern
Europe had rejected the pope's leadership, leaving the continent divided along
religious lines.
Back in Rome, the pope condemned Luther as a heretic, and a series of religious
wars ensued between Catholics and Luther's followers. Those wars continued
intermittently for a century, until the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. With Luther's
revolt against Rome, the religious unity of Western Europe had been shattered
forever.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. England's King Henry VIII initially opposed Luther, but he rejected
Catholicism in 1534 after the pope refused to allow him to divorce his wife,
Catherine ofAragon.
2. In 1522, Luther produced a German translation of the New Testament in only
eleven weeks, giving Germans the first chance to read the holy book in their
own language.
TUESDAY, DAY 2
Beowulf
The eighth-century poem Beowulf, whose author remains unknown, is the great
heroic epic of Old English. From its pages, scholars have learned volumes about
the development of the English language. It also reflects the mix of pagan
traditions and Christianity that characterized northern Europe during the early
Middle Ages.
Beowulf opens at the mead hall of the Danish king, Hrothgar, in the sixth
century. For years, a monster called Grendel has terrorized Hrothgar's court,
breaking in at night and devouring his warriors. Beowulf, a young prince from
Geatland (a region in the south of Sweden), arrives out of the blue with a band of
men and dispatches the monster quickly. Grendel's equally fearsome mother,
however, returns to avenge her son, so Beowulf tracks her down to her lair and
slays her as well. Upon returning to his kingdom a hero, Beowulf rules as king
for fifty years and eventually dies defending his people from a dragon.
Thematically, the poem mixes tenets of the old Germanic warrior code with
elements of Christianity, which at the time was still relatively new to northern
Europe. The original Beowulf legend, as told and retold orally for generations,
had glorified strength, valor, loyalty, and vengeance. The Beowulf poet
occasionally tries to incorporate Christian themes of humility and forgiveness
into the original Germanic story, and the tension between the two is at times
jarring.
Beowulf is written in Old English, the heavily Germanic forerunner to Middle
English and modern English. As evidenced in the poem's openingverse, Old
English is virtually unreadable today without translation:
Like much Old English poetry, Beowulf uses complicated rules of alliteration
that helped bards recite the thousands of lines ofverse from memory. It also
makes heavy use ofkennings-short, descriptive metaphors that add color to the
poet's descriptions. For instance, the Beowulf poet refers to the sea as the
"whale-road" and a king as a "ring-giver."
Though Beowulf's influence on the development of English literature is often
overstated-as the poem was largely forgotten until the 1800s-it is nonetheless a
priceless literary and historical document. Since its renewed rise to prominence
in the twentieth century, it has inspired the works of poets and novelists from W.
H. Auden to J. R. R. Tolkien.
ADDITIONAL FACT
1. Only one manuscript copy ofBeowulf exists. Likely created around 1000 AD,
it was damaged badly in a fire in 1731 and is now kept at the British Library in
London.
WEDNESDAY, DAY 3
The Sistine Chapel
The Sistine Chapel in the Vatican Palace is best known for the ceiling painted by
Michelangelo between 1508 and 1512. Covering the walls of the room are
frescoes by Sandro Botticelli, Pietro Perugino, Luca Signorelli, and other early
Renaissance masters. The area beneath these paintings was once covered by a set
of tapestries designed by Raphael.
The word Sistine stems from the name of the original patron of the chapel, Pope
Sixtus IV. The building itself was built between 1475 and 1483, according to the
dimensions of Solomon's Temple as described in the Old Testament. In 1507,
Pope Julius II commissioned Michelangelo to redo the ceiling, the vaults of
which had originally been covered with a painting of a starry sky by Pier Matteo
d'Amelia. Michelangelo was initially reluctant to take on the task since he had
little experience painting. All the same, he succeeded in creating a vast pictorial
program with more than 300 figures depicting the creation, fall, and redemption
of mankind. Although he claimed to have designed and painted the ceiling
entirely by himself, it is more than likely that he was provided with a theological
advisor and assistants. His poems describe how difficult it was to paint in a
reclining position on top of a scaffold.
Nine scenes from Genesis run down the center of the ceiling. The first three are
devoted to the Creation, the next three to the story of Adam and Eve, and the
final three to the story of Noah. Michelangelo painted them in reverse order,
hesitating to represent God until he had gained more experience with the brush.
Seated on the architectural framework dividing the scenes are male nudes known
as ignudi. Smaller nudes carrying biblical texts appear in the painted bronze
medallions arranged regularly over the entire ceiling. The four vaults at the
corners of the room show scenes of the Israelites' salvation. Seven huge Old
Testament prophets and five pagan sibyls (female seers from Roman mythology
later absorbed into Christian tradition) are seated along the base of the ceiling.
Beneath them are sixteen lunettes portraying Christ's ancestors.
Michelangelo was careful to depict God over the part of the chapel reserved for
the cardinals.
A complete restoration of the frescoes, funded by Fuji Film, was carried out
between 1981 and 1994. The cleaning disclosed that Michelangelo had used
extremely vibrant colors, a revelation that shocked many modern art historians.
Eighteenth-century German scholar Johann Wolfang von Goethe, admiring the
ceiling on his tour of Italy, noted that, "Without having seen the Sistine Chapel,
one can form no appreciable idea of what one man is capable of achieving."
THURSDAY, DAY 4
Radiocarbon Dating
Scientists use radiocarbon dating to determine the age of once-living organisms.
The method can accurately date anything from bone and cloth to wood and
straw. Scientists look for levels of carbon-14, a rare form of carbon that begins to
decay and disappear as soon as an organism dies. The older the object, the less
carbon-14 it will contain.
All living organisms on earth are based on carbon. Normal carbon atoms
(carbon-12) have six protons and six neutrons. However, sometimes cosmic rays
entering the earth's atmosphere will bombard nitrogen atoms, changing them into
a special type of radioactive carbon called carbon-14. Carbon-14 has two more
neutrons than normal carbon. Over the course of 5,730 years, half of any given
sample of carbon-14 will decay back into nitrogen. In other words, carbon-14
has a half-life of 5,730 years.
Plants and animals can't distinguish between carbon-12 and carbon-14. They
consume them both until they die. However, when a plant or animal dies, the
levels of carbon-14 in the organism start to decline. (The carbon-14 begins to
decay and, because the organism is no longer consuming carbon, it is not being
replenished.) At the same time, the amount of carbon-12 in the sample remains
constant, as it is a stable molecule that does not decay. To determine the age of a
dead object, scientists compare its ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 to the ratio in
an equivalent living object.
If a dead object has half the ratio of a living object, then it is approximately
5,730 years old, because carbon-14 has a half-life of 5,730 years. If the ratio is
one-quarter the living comparison, then the object is 11,460 years old. If the ratio
is one-eighth, then the object is 17,190 years old, and so forth. If an object is
much older than 60,000 years, there isn't enough carbon-14 left to be used
scientifically.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Radioactive uranium has a half-life of 704 million years and can be used to
date objects on a geologic scale.
2. Potassium-40, which is naturally found in the human body, has a half-life of
1.3 billion years. It has been used to date the beginning oflife on the planet.
3. Willard F. Libby developed radiocarbon dating at the University of Chicago in
the 1950s. He won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1960.
4. Anything that has died since 1940 will be harder to test using carbon dating
because nuclear activity has changed what had been roughly constant levels of
radioactive material on the planet.
FRIDAY, DAY 5
Classical Period
The classical period of music, which immediately followed the baroque period
and directly preceded the romantic period, lasted from about 1750 (the death of
Johann Sebastian Bach) to about 1827 (Ludwig van Beethoven's death). It
coincided with the intellectual epoch known as the Age of Enlightenment, whose
disciples, philosophers like Rene Descartes, Voltaire, and Henri Rousseau,
emphasized individual rights and freedoms, human worth, and rationality. Many
endeavors in art, politics, and philosophy were celebrations of the human mind's
ability to reason.
In art and music, this spirit translated into a devotion to Greco-Roman culture
and aesthetic ideas: proportion, balance, poise, and simplicity. Apollo, the god of
reason, thought, and music was exalted. The classical composers-Johann
Christian Bach, and later Franz Joseph Haydn, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and
the early Beethoven- shared a remarkable unity of style. Their emphasis was not
on experimental effects or unpredictability. Rather, they were formalists who
strove toward perfection. Like the Renaissance sculptors, they tried to make art
that would last for centuries, as near as possible to a flawless representation of
human ideals.
During the classical period, composers perfected and standardized the concerto,
sonata, and symphony forms. The precedents they set were adhered to as the
ultimate standard in art music for decades that followed. At the same time, they
did not sacrifice the emotional quality of their work. Mozart's symphonies and
operas, Haydn's string trios, and Beethoven's violin sonatas are rich in expressive
textures. They are admired for their originality and their lyrical, moving
melodies as much as for their mastery of form.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. The term classical music is often used to distinguish between European art
music and rock, pop, or folk music. This distinction first came into use
sometime in the 1790s.
2. Classical composers, like the baroque composers before them, depended on
patronage to make a living. They worked generally in the royal courts, but
within that context had a relatively low standing as servants to the monarch or
lord. Many of them, such as Mozart, died paupers and were buried in unmarked
graves.
SATURDAY, DAY 6
The Mind/Body Problem
Stubbing your toe causes you to feel pain. Your toe hitting an object is a physical
event, and it causes your nerves to fire in a certain pattern, which sends a signal
to your brain. But what exactly is the pain you feel?
There are two questions philosophers ask about the relation between states of
your bodylike stubbing your toe-and states of your mind-like feeling pain. First,
are mental states identical with physical states? Is pain just the firing of those
neurons in the brain? If so, then it would seem that your mind is nothing more
than your brain. But, if pain is something more than firing neurons, then there is
room to think that your mind is something extra, something you have in addition
to a body and brain. This position is called dualism.
The second question is: If the mind is distinct from the brain, how do events in
the body, especially events in the brain, cause events in the mind, and vice versa?
After all, if the mind is distinct from the brain and the rest of the body, it seems
that it must be immaterial, in other words, not made up of matter. So how does it
interact with the matter that makes up your brain and body? Some philosophers
believe that the mind and the body can interact in the same way that matter can
interact with matter. Other philosophers, called epiphenomenalists, believe that
the body can cause effects in the mind, but the mind cannot cause effects in the
body.
The mind/body problem remains a live debate in philosophy because it raises
important questions about psychology and neuroscience. Further, it poses serious
obstacles in the effort to develop artificial intelligence. We may be able to
recreate the brain with a computer, but can we recreate the mind?
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Descartes was a substance dualist. He believed that the mind and the body are
distinct things, and that they could exist without one another.
2. Thought experiment: Is itpossiblefor someone to have a brain that is exactly
like yours, with all the neurons firing exactly the same way, but who doesn't
experience or feel anything? If you believe that a zombie like this is possible,
then you think that dualism is true.
3. Descartes believed that the mind and body interact, and he thought he knew
where: in the pinealgland (also known as the epiphysis), apart ofthe brain!
SUNDAY, DAY 7
The Good Samaritan
The Good Samaritan is one of the most famous parables told by Jesus. It is
recounted in the Gospel of Luke and defines a standard of love toward which
Jesus wished his followers to aspire.
A lawyer asked Jesus how to be saved. Jesus asked in reply, "What is written in
the Torah?" The lawyer recounted the Torah sayings of "Love God" and "Love
thy neighbor." Jesus said that following these doctrines leads to salvation. So the
lawyer asked, in essence, "How can I identify who is my neighbor?" Jesus then
began the parable.
Jesus told of a traveler who is attacked, robbed, and left on the side of a road. A
priest passes by, but he avoids the man due to his disheveled appearance. Next, a
Levite, a member of another revered sect, passes and ignores the stricken man as
well. Finally, a Samaritan passes by. Samaritans were an ostracized and hated
ethnicity at the time. According to the story, though, the Samaritan is the only
one who decides to help by clothing, sheltering, and feeding the victim.
Turning to the lawyer who was questioning him, Jesus explained that it was the
Samaritan, least likely to help the traveler and with nothing to gain, who was
actually the traveler's neighbor.
This is an excellent example of how Jesus often shocked his audience to get his
point across. The celebration of a Samaritan, though hardly controversial today,
would have caused astonishment at the time, thus emphasizing the importance of
aiding people in need and the closeness of all humankind.
Although this is a relatively small passage in Luke, the concept of the Good
Samaritan has become accepted into the mainstream by Christians and non-
Christians alike.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Ethnic Samaritans, now numbered in the hundreds and mostly living in
northern Israel, became so scarce that the effect of choosing a Samaritan as the
hero of the story has been lost. Over time, however, some retellers have
attempted to insert more relevant ethnicities.
2. A Good Samaritan now refers to a person who unselfishly helps a person in
need, regardless of other circumstances.
3. Good Samaritan Laws exist in many countries today. They protect people who
help others from being sued.

WEEK 17

MONDAY, DAY I
Spain in the New World
When Columbus set sail in 1492, he wasn't looking for a new world. Rather, he
was trying to find a new sea passage to Asia for King Ferdinand and Queen
Isabella. But the opportunity to conquer the vast areas Columbus found was
irresistible. Spanish soldiers spent the next fiftyyears conquering huge territories
in Central and South America, killing thousands of Native Americans in the
process. Extracting fabulous riches from the New World, Spain was at its height
as a world superpower.
In 1550, Ferdinand and Isabella's grandson, King Charles V, summoned two
prominent scholars to the country's main university at Valladolid for a far-
reaching debate about his foreign policy. The bloodshed in the Americas worried
the king. Was it right to continue expanding Spain's empire at such a cost in
human lives?
On one side of the debate at Valladolid was a Dominican monk named
Bartolome de las Casas. As a child in 1493, las Casas had attended the victory
parade in Seville that greeted Christopher Columbus after his discovery of the
Americas. In 1502, las Casas moved to America with several relatives, part of
the initial wave of Spanish settlement. In the New World, las Casas was appalled
by the cruelty of the Spanish conquistadors that he witnessed firsthand. In front
of the king, las Casas pleaded for a more humane Spanish policy in the
Americas.
On the other side of the debate was Juan Gines de Sepulveda, a humanist scholar
who believed that the Spanish had a duty to "Christianize" the American Indians
by whatever means necessary. To Sepulveda, native tribes like the Aztecs were
barbarians who practiced human sacrifice and cannibalism. Not only did the
Spanish have a right to subjugate the natives, Sepulveda said they had a positive
obligation to spread Western civilization. "The perfect should command and rule
over the imperfect," he wrote in 1547, citing Aristotle to defend what he called
the "just war" against the Indians.
Within two generations, the Spanish had destroyed the great Aztec and Inca
empires. The king was sympathetic to the pleadings of las Casas, but it was too
late. For better or worse, the European colonization of the Americas was
underway.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Large parts ofSouth America remained Spanish possessions for the next three
centuries until the Napoleonic wars in Europe weakened Spain's grasp on its
colonies. Mexico gained independence in 1821, and Peru followed in 1824.
Spain did not lose its last colonial possessions until the Spanish-American War
in 1898.
2. Far more Native Americans died from the diseases introduced by European
explorers than perished in war. Smallpox was one of the many "virgin soil
epidemics" that killed millions ofIndians.
3. Spanish explorers founded the city of St. Augustine, Florida, in 1565, making
it the oldest continually occupied European settlement in the United States.
TUESDAY, DAY 2
Salman Rushdie
Born in Bombay to Muslim parents, raised among Hindus and Sikhs, educated in
England, and now living in New York, novelist Salman Rushdie (1947-)is a
walking embodiment of post-modernism and post-colonialism. His devilishly
clever and quirky novels, steeped in both realism and fantasy, are for many the
literary voice of modern India. Rushdie's novels address a host of political and
religious issues, especially the tense relationship between Hinduism and Islam in
India and Pakistan.
Ironically, much of Rushdie's fame is due not to his remarkable writing but to the
furor that erupted in response to his novel The Satanic Verses (1988). The novel
contains passages that many Muslims perceived as blasphemous slights against
the Prophet Muhammad. The novel was banned in India, Pakistan, Egypt, Saudi
Arabia, and elsewhere, and violent public protests and book burnings were
widespread, from the Middle East to Great Britain. In early 1989, the Ayatollah
Khomeini of Iran issued a fatwa, or edict, calling for Rushdie's death and
exhorting Muslims worldwide to track him down. Rushdie spent the better part
of a decade in hiding, protected by agents from Scotland Yard.
The notoriety of The Satanic Verses often eclipses Rushdie's greatest
achievement, Midnight's Children (1981). The novel's protagonist, Saleem Sinai,
is born at the stroke ofmidnight on August 15, 1947, the day India won
independence from Great Britain and Pakistan was partitioned off as a separate
nation. Like the hundreds of other "midnight's children" born during the same
hour, Saleem has supernatural powers, and events in his life mirror
developments in the young nation of India as a whole. Elements of the story are
autobiographical-Rushdie himself was born in Bombay in 1947-but much of
Midnight's Children takes place in a fantastical landscape, following in the
footsteps of Gunter Grass, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, and other pioneers of magic
realism. The novel earned Rushdie the Booker Prize in 1981.
Though Rushdie will forever be associated with the ayatollah's death sentence
against him, his novels are actually quite light-hearted, celebrated for their
inventive use of language. His prose is like a verbal jungle gym, full of allusions
and playful tricks. His characters, like Rushdie himself, represent the modern
immigrant experience and the intermingling of cultures in today's world.
Rushdie has continued to write in this vein despite the threats against his life,
producing the novels Haroun and the Sea of Stories (1990) and The Moor's Last
Sigh (1995), among others.
ADDITIONAL FACT
1. Rushdie's highly unflattering depiction ofIndian prime minister Indira Gandhi
in Midnight's Children prompted her to file a successful libel lawsuit against
him. The issue was dropped only upon Gandhi's assassination in 1984.
WEDNESDAY, DAY 3
Raphael
Along with Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, Raphael (1483-1520) is
considered one of the three greatest artists of the High Renaissance in Italy.
Born near Urbino in 1483, Raphael was trained by his father, Giovanni Santi.
Recognizing the boy's genius, Giovanni sent him to the workshop of Pietro
Perugino, a leading painter in the region of Umbria at the time. In 1504, Raphael
moved to Florence, the artistic hub of Italy in the early sixteenth century.
Studying the works of Michelangelo and Leonardo, Raphael combined elements
from both to come up with a style entirely his own.
In 1508, Raphael was summoned to Rome by Pope Julius II to work on a suite of
papal rooms. In the first room, probably the pope's library, Raphael painted
frescoes of what were considered the four major disciplines: theology,
philosophy, law, and poetry. The most famous of these, philosophy, later entitled
the School of Athens, presents Plato and Aristotle set in a vast architectural
space and surrounded by all the great thinkers of ancient Greece.
Raphael remained in Rome for the rest of his short but prolific life. In addition to
many altarpieces and devotional paintings, he also painted mythological scenes,
such as the Galatea, which was commissioned for the Villa Farnesina in 1512,
and which depicts the nymph pursued by the giant Polyphemus. Raphael
likewise earned a reputation as an architect and was appointed to supervise the
construction of new Saint Peter's Basilica when Bramante, its initial designer,
died in 1514. He was also a gifted portraitist, as can be seen in his painting of
Baldassare Castiglione, a prominent diplomat and author, who mentioned
Raphael in his famous Renaissance treatise, The Book of the Courtier.
One of Raphael's most famous images of the Virgin and child, the Sistine
Madonna (15121514) has provoked much discussion due to the unusually
startled expression on the faces of both figures. Recent research has shown that
the work's original location in the church was such that the figures would have
been looking at a crucifix.
Raphael is generally said to be the most classical of the three great Renaissance
masters. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, in fact, claimed that Raphael did not
have to imitate the Greeks since it was natural for him to think and feel as they
did.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. The earliest biography ofRaphael appears in Giorgio Vasari's Lives of the
Artists (1550).
2. In the School of Athens, Plato points his finger up to indicate his interest in
abstract, ethereal concepts, while Aristotle gestures down to theground to show
his preference for concrete subjects and worldly affairs.
3. Raphael also explored Roman ruins, most notably the buried remains of the
Golden House ofNero, the Domus Aurea.
THURSDAY, DAY 4
Albert Einstein
We tend to picture Albert Einstein as an old professor with a black moustache
and tufts of white hair, but actually, he produced his greatest contributions to
math and physics when he was only twenty-six years old. In 1905, while
working as a patent office clerk in Bern, Switzerland, Einstein wrote four papers
that are each regarded as works of genius. The year 1905 is known as annus
mirabilis, Einstein's "year of miracles."
Einstein's first paper, "On a Heuristic Viewpoint Concerning the Production and
Transformation of Light," proposed that light was made up of small packets of
energy called energy quanta. We refer to them today as photons. This was the
theory that won Einstein the Nobel Prize.
Einstein's second paper provided some of the first empirical evidence for the
existence of atoms. Before 1905, the idea of an atom as the smallest unit of
matter was regarded as a useful theoretical concept. Einstein described the
movement of particles suspended in liquid, called Brownian motion, and proved
that matter must have an underlying structure. That structure is explained by the
modern concept of the atom.
Einstein's third and fourth papers treated the topic that most made him famous-
his special theory of relativity. The theory explained the relationship between
energy and mass, with the famous equation E=mc2-the energy of an object
equals its mass times the speed of light squared. Grossly simplified, this means
that mass is another form of energy.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Einstein's papers on the theory of relativity were a continuation of work he
began when he was sixteen years old.
2. Although Einstein encouraged President Franklin Roosevelt to build the
nuclear bomb during World War II, he actively supported nuclear disarmament.
He once said, "I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but
I know World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones."
3. Einstein was asked to be the second president oflsrael, but he declined saying
he lacked the people skills.
FRIDAY, DAY 5
Franz Joseph Haydn
In the Viennese tradition of ingenious court composers, Franz Joseph Haydn
(1732-1809) was the first real darling of the classical era. He was born in 1732
and grew up poor in the Austrian town of Rohrau to a laborer father. His aptitude
for music was apparent even as a young boy, and at age eight he became a
choirboy at the Cathedral of St. Stephen in Vienna.
From 1759 to 1761, Haydn worked in the court of Count Morzin, a lowlevel
nobleman who went bankrupt and had to fire all his musicians. By that time,
however, Haydn had attracted enough attention to be hired by a Hungarian
Prince named Paul Anton Esterhazy. He spent most of his life at the house of
Esterhaz, composing for eight hours a day and managing all of the estate's
musical activities, which included multiple opera and symphonic performances
each week.
If Haydn's schedule sounds arduous, his career output is equally amazing: he
wrote 104 symphonies, 68 string quartets, 47 piano sonatas, 26 operas, 4
oratorios, and hundreds of other pieces that have since been lost. He is credited
with establishing the standard structure for a symphony-three or four movements
of varied tempos, scored for strings, four or five wind parts and timpani-which
he developed from the ideas of several Italian, Rococo composers. He is also
credited with modernizing the string quartet format. Instead of making his
quartets solo exercises for the first violinist, he moved his melodies and
important themes around between the violin, viola, and cello parts.
Haydn spent the latter part of his life traveling between London and Vienna,
while composing his most mature and lasting symphonies and string quartets. He
met with, and provided inspiration for, the young Mozart, his most talented
contemporary. He retired and eventually died in 1809 in Vienna at the age of
seventy-seven.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. In most baroque compositions, each movement is limited to one mood or
emotional texture (sad, wintry, joyful, etc.). Haydn was one of the first
composers to write pieces, namely his symphonies, that shifted through
multiple expressive settings. He also eliminated the baroque continuo part and
replaced it with more complex orchestrations using the many instruments in an
orchestra.
2. While staying atEsterhkz, Haydn lived for two decades in servant's quarters,
wearing a footman's uniform and having to deal with the humiliation of being
chastised for not powdering his servants wig properly.
3. When Haydn's voice changed in 1749, he was kicked out of St. Stephen's
boys's choir to the streets with nothing but the clothes on his back, another
indication ofa musician's station in life. He survived by giving lessons,
composing diversion music for the wealthy of the city, and working as a
servant and apprentice to the Italian composer Nicola Porpora.
SATURDAY, DAY 6
Baruch Spinoza
Baruch Spinoza (1632-1677) was born in 1632 into Amsterdam's community of
Marranos, Jews who had once secretly practiced their religion in Spain before
being expelled. In 1656, he was excommunicated from the Jewish community
and later changed his name to the more Latin-sounding Benedict, by which he is
usually referred.
During his life and after, Spinoza's philosophical ideas were deeply
controversial. In 1670, he published the TheologicalPolitical Treatise, in which
he argued that the Bible, like all scriptures, should be interpreted as a document
produced by human beings, and not by God. Spinoza contended the real content
of religion did not concern the nature of God, but rather with guiding people to
do what is morally right through stories and precepts. Thus, religion is a system
of moral and political control, and all religions are equally valid, insofar as they
perform this task effectively. These views were so controversial in seventeenth-
century Europe that Spinoza published the book anonymously.
Much of Spinoza's philosophical labors were devoted to his magnum opus,
Ethics, which was published after his death. In this book, Spinoza presented a
systematic account of God, nature, the mind, and the attainment of happiness.
For Spinoza, everything in nature was governed by strict, and necessary, causal
laws. Therefore, everything is a necessary consequence of necessary laws, and
nothing could have been different than how it is. Spinoza believed God was
simply the totality of nature, not an independent creator. He concluded there is
no meaning, or purpose, to the world. In the final book of Ethics, Spinoza
considered how, given this, we can still be happy.
Working for much of his life as a lens-grinder, Spinoza died at The Hague in
1677.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Although we do not know for certain, Spinoza was probably excommunicated
for denying that the soul is immortal and that God created the world for a
purpose.
2. Spinoza called the state of happiness beatitude.
SUNDAY, DAY 7
Apostles
Among Jesus's followers were his disciples, who traveled with and learned from
him; and his apostles, whom he chose to continue his teachings after he died.
The twelve apostles were, in effect, the first missionaries. They were the twelve
men Jesus dined with on the night before he was crucified. Additionally, they
were among those Jesus revealed himself to after he had been resurrected.
The number twelve reflected the original twelve tribes of Israel. Some of Jesus's
followers believed the restoration of ancient Israel would coincide with the
coming Kingdom of Heaven.
Some of the more notable Apostles are:
SIMON: Simon was called Peter by Jesus. He was given a rare leadership role
by Jesus and eventually became the first pope. Jesus told him, "You are Peter,
and on this rock I will build my church" (Matthew 16:13-20) It is debated
whether the "rock" was Peter himself, as the Catholics believe, establishing the
papacy, or simply Peter's faith.
ANDREW: Andrew, Simon's brother, was one of Jesus's first followers and
convinced Simon to become a disciple as well.
JOHN: John was purportedly the author of the Gospel of John and perhaps four
additional New Testament books.
MATTHEW: Matthew, called Levi in some textual references, is believed to be
the author of the Gospel of Matthew.
THOMAS: Thomas was very skeptical of Jesus's resurrection from the dead and
demanded to feel his wounds before believing in the miracle.
JUDAS ISCARIOT: Judas was the man who betrayed Jesus by kissing him. This
kiss allowed the authorities to identify him. By some accounts, Judas committed
suicide out of guilt during the three days between Jesus's crucifixion and
resurrection.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. According to Mormon beliefs, after Jesus was resurrected, he went to South
America and chose a set of twelve apostles there. Among these were the Three
Nephites, who did not die, but rather remain on Earth today awaiting the
second coming ofjesus.
2. Apart from the twelve original apostles, several other successful missionaries
have received the title of apostle over the centuries of Christian history. The
honor is bestowed on people who bring Christianity to a particular country,
area, or population for the first time.

WEEK 18

MONDAY, DAY I
British Settlement in North America
British settlers arrived on the shores of North America in two groups. First, in
the early 1600s, English entrepreneurs built a colony at Jamestown in Virginia to
look for riches in the New World, following the example of the early Spanish
settlers in South America. After many setbacks, the Virginia colony grew into a
prosperous commercial venture. At about the same time, another group of pious
British settlers arrived in Massachusetts. This group was looking for religious
freedom that had been denied them in England.
Many historians have identified the two groups of British settlers as the source
of an enduring tension in the American identity. Driven by a religious fervor, the
New England settlers wanted to build a community in the rocky soil of
Massachusetts that would set an example for the whole world. John Winthrop,
the leader of the Puritans who settled in Boston, described their mission in a
famous sermon, "We shall be as a city upon a hill. The eyes of all people are
upon us" The Massachusetts Bay Colony enforced a rigid code of laws based on
the Bible, harshly punishing adulterers and suspected unbelievers.
The Virginia colonists, in contrast, were much more concerned with turning a
profit. While the dour clergymen of Boston tried to enforce public virtue, the
first act of the Virginia legislature in 1619 was to regulate tobacco prices.
The rest of the thirteen colonies reflected the mixed motives of the British.
Pennsylvania became a haven for persecuted Quakers. New York started as a
short-lived Dutch trading colony conquered by the British in 1664. The separate
groups of British colonists initially felt little kinship with one another, but a
common resentment of heavy-handed British rule helped bring the thirteen
colonies together.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. The colony ofMaryland was founded in 1634 as a safe haven for British
Catholics, whose religion had fallen out of favor in England after the
reformation in the sixteenth century.
2. Several other European powers established short-lived colonies in North
America. Swedish settlers founded Delaware in 1638, but their colony lasted
only a few years. The state of Vermont was first settled by the French, briefly
became an independent country in the eighteenth century, and in 1791 became
the fourteenth state to join the Union.
3. The religious persecution suffered in Europe by many American colonists
didn't stop them from mistreating religious dissidents in the New World. The
Massachusetts Puritans, who had fled from England, hanged several Quakers in
Boston for defying orders to leave the commonwealth.
TUESDAY, DAY 2
Pride and Prejudice
Pride and Prejudice (1813) is arguably the most popular work of British novelist
Jane Austen. Along with Austen's other novels, it was groundbreaking for its
focus on middle-class life. The aristocratic realm had largely been the focus of
earlier British literature. Its surprisingly modern plot, replete with comedy and
irony, has kept it a favorite for generations.
Born in 1775, Austen was the seventh of eight children. Her middle-class parents
impressed upon her the value of reading and scholarship. She was enrolled
briefly at a ladies' boarding school, which was more education than most
Englishwomen of her station received at the time. Encouraged by her parents,
she began writing, finishing a first draft of Pride and Prejudice as early as 1796.
After the manuscript was rejected by a publisher, Austen set it aside and worked
on other projects for more than ten years before returning to it.
Pride and Prejudice recounts the romantic anxieties of a young woman,
Elizabeth Bennet, and her four sisters. Like Austen herself, Elizabeth is of
middle-class upbringing. Although Mr. and Mrs. Bennet originally stood to
inherit an estate, the fact that they have five daughters and no son means that the
estate has been entailed, or forfeited, to a relative, the obnoxious brownnoser Mr.
Collins. This unfortunate situation leaves Mrs. Bennet constantly fretting about
her daughters' marital prospects.
At a ball one evening, Elizabeth meets a wealthy young man named Mr. Darcy.
Though the two are intrigued by each other, Elizabeth is turned off by Darcy's
arrogance, and he by the unsophisticated antics of her middle-class family. After
a long string of awkward confrontations, mutual misunderstandings, and self-
recriminations, Elizabeth and Darcy realize their love for each other and
ultimately become engaged.
Pride and Prejudice is beloved for its wit, insight, and richly drawn characters.
The feisty, independent Elizabeth is one of literature's great heroines. Mrs.
Bennet is a clucking hen of a mother, prone to constant dramatics that the
devoted Mr. Bennet bears with resignation. Perhaps most memorable is Darcy's
venomously snobby aunt, Lady Catherine, who is aghast at the prospect of her
nephew buying into the "upstart pretensions of a young woman without family,
connections, or fortune." The combination of these affectionately rendered
portraits with incisive humor and a satisfying ending makes Pride and Prejudice
one of the most entertaining classics of English literature.
ADDITIONAL FACT
1. Austen's untimely death in 1817 cut short her productive career. Her novels
Northanger Abbey and Persuasion were publishedposthumously in 1818.
WEDNESDAY, DAY 3
Baroque Art
The age of the baroque is generally dated by historians as lasting from 1600 to
1750. The artistic style spread throughout western Europe, taking on different
characteristics as it developed against the backdrop of the Protestant
Reformation and the Catholic Counter-Reformation. Baroque art is usually
described as theatrical, emotionally appealing, dynamic, and awe-inspiring.
Much baroque art in Italy and other Catholic countries was a direct response to
Protestantism. Luther and his followers had criticized the Roman church for
excess pageantry and for propagating the veneration of images. Catholic
authorities responded by defending the use of devotional images, but decreed
that artists should be forced to follow stricter guidelines and create pictures that
related biblical events clearly, vividly, and realistically. Such images, they felt,
would help nurture piety in believers. Architecture, on the other hand, should
celebrate the power of the papacy and its victory over rebellious Protestant sects.
In Italy, the greatest baroque project was the completion of the new St. Peter's
Basilica. This was very much a collaborative project. The famous sculptor and
architect Gian Lorenzo Bernini oversaw the sculptural program of the entire
basilica, and he designed the oval colonnaded piazza in front. Carlo Maderno
built the facade. A wide variety of baroque painters executed altarpieces for the
interior.
Baroque took a somewhat different direction in Protestant countries such as
Holland. There it was used to glorify the young republic, rather than the papacy
or ruling monarch. It also led to greater interest in atmospheric effects and
human emotion in painting, as can be seen in the work of the two most famous
Dutch artists of the seventeenth century, Rembrandt van Rijn and Jan Vermeer.
In Protestant England, the Baroque made its mark in the architecture of Sir
Christopher Wren, especially in his design for new St. Paul's Cathedral, built
between 1675 and 1710.
In the eighteenth century, the baroque gradually gave way to the more ornate
style of the rococo.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. The term baroque was first used pejoratively in the nineteenth century to
criticize the period. Today it is used colloquially to mean "extravagant,"
"complex," or "bizarre."
2. The Italian baroque painter Caravaggio's The Death of the Virgin caused a
scandal when it was first exhibited because the artist depicted Mary with a
bloated stomach, something that was considered indecorous for a saint.
According to legend, Caravaggio used a local prostitute as his model.
THURSDAY, DAY 4
Charles Darwin and Natural Selection
In 1842, Charles Darwin began to write The Origin of Species. He was not the
first person to propose that populations evolve over time, but he was the first to
propose a theory for why it happened.
Born into the affluent gentry of Shropshire, England, Darwin enjoyed a
privileged childhood. His father was a wealthy doctor, and his mother was the
daughter of the famous potter Josiah Wedgwood. Naturally squeamish, Darwin
could not follow in his father's footsteps as a physician. Still, his father wanted
him to have a profession, so he was sent to the clergy. Darwin had an affinity for
natural observation, anatomy, geology, and botany, but not much interest in
religion. After three years of studying divinity at Christ's Church, Cambridge,
Darwin seized the opportunity to leave the Church. At twenty-two years old, he
climbed aboard the HMS Beagle, mostly to serve as a genteel traveling
companion for the patrician captain, Robert FitzRoy, who feared the loneliness
of command at sea.
For the next five years, Darwin sailed around the islands of the South Pacific,
South America, and Australia. His observations of plants and animals, most
notably the rare creatures of the Galapagos Islands, were the basis for his theory
of evolution. He noticed how animals seemed to fit their environments. A bird
with a long, narrow beak sipped nectar from a plant with long narrow flowers.
He concluded that this did not happen by chance. The birds with the longest,
most narrow beaks would have the best chance of survival, and therefore of
passing on their physical characteristics to the next generation. Thus, the birds
evolved over time to fit the flowers. Birds with short, fat beaks would have
simply died out. This process of natural selection could be used to explain the
characteristics of all creatures on earth. From seaweed to blue whales, all
populations, he concluded, evolved through "survival of the fittest."
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Darwin did not reveal his findings to the public for more than twentyyears. He
had serious qualms about the impact they might have on religion.
2. The Origin of Species was a bestseller when it was finally published in 1859.
3. Darwin suffered from many debilitating illnesses after the release ofthe book.
Although he was an adamant believer in science, he still tried quack remedies,
such as soaking his neck in vinegar and tying a chain around his neck.
FRIDAY, DAY 5
Haydn's London Symphonies
When Franz Joseph Haydn made his two longest visits to London in 1791-1792
and 1794-1795, he was greeted by fame and a frenzied media attention that had
not been bestowed upon a foreign composer since Handel arrived eighty years
earlier.
Haydn had just left Vienna and his young friend Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and
the works he wrote while in England bear the stamp of the mutually influential
musical relationship that the two composers shared. In fact, Haydn was the only
composer whom the arrogant Mozart would recognize as his superior, though
Haydn deferred modestly to his young colleague.
The London Symphonies were composed on commission for J. P. Salomon, an
impresario who was organizing a series of concerts at London's Hanover Square
Rooms. The first six were performed during the 1791-1792 season, and the
second six during the 1794-1795 season. Among Haydn's most famous works,
they were harmonically challenging pieces that owed a lot to Mozart's
symphonic innovations.
Symphony No. 94, the "Surprise Symphony," is so-called because in the middle
of the second movement, a loud bang from the full orchestra completely changes
the feel of the piece. Some critics argued, presumably in jest, that it was to wake
up any listeners who had dozed off.
Symphony No. 103 possessed the first symphony movement to begin with a
drum roll (thus, it is sometimes called the "Drum Roll Symphony"), and
Symphony No. 104, "The London," is possibly the finest example of mature
classical symphony composition.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. It is rumored that, on Haydn's departure for London, Mozart prophetically told
him, "We shall never meet again. "Mozart died before Haydn returned.
2. Symphony No. 100 is called The Military" because ofits clanging kettle drums
and cymbals.
3. While writing the London Symphonies, Haydn was having a love affair with a
woman named Widow Schroeter. He wrote that she was "still handsome,
"despite being older than sixty.
SATURDAY, DAY 6
A Priori Knowledge
Much of our knowledge of the world comes from experiencing it. We know
there is a tree outside a window, for instance, because we see it. We know the
tree requires sunlight and water to thrive, because scientists have carefully
observed these facts. In general, we know about our immediate environment by
perceiving it, and we gain scientific knowledge about the world by observing it
and conducting experiments on it.
However, some of our knowledge does not depend upon experience in this way.
For instance, we know that all bachelors are unmarried men. What is our
justification for believing this? It does not depend upon any experience. If it
were, then each of us would have to go out and investigate bachelors and
determine that they are unmarried men in order to know this. But we don't. Just
by knowing the meaning of the words bachelor and unmarried men, we know
that all bachelors are unmarried men. (Admittedly, we need to experience the
world in order to learn what those words mean. But the issue is whether, having
understood what those words mean, we need further experience in order to
justify believing that all bachelors are unmarried men. It appears that we do not.)
Even more tellingly, what experience would lead us to deny that all bachelors are
unmarried men? If no such experience is possible, it seems that our justification
for believing it is independent of our experience.
Knowledge that does not depend upon experience is called a priori knowledge,
because it is justified prior to experience. Other examples of a priori knowledge
are mathematical expressions. We know that 1+1=2. But we do not know this
through experience. A good test of whether some claim is justified a priori is:
Would we be willing to give up this claim in the face of experience? To say that
1+1=2 is known a priori is to say we don't need to give up that claim, no matter
how our experience turns out.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Philosophers disagree about whether we can have a priori knowledge of
anything other than logic and the meanings ofour words.
2. Some philosophers believe that we have no a priori knowledge whatsoever.
Even our knowledge of mathematics and logic, they insist, ultimately depends
upon experience.
SUNDAY, DAY 7
Mary Magdalene
Mary Magdalene, or Mary of Magdala, was one of Jesus's most prominent
disciples and certainly his most discussed female disciple. The canonical
Gospels recount that Mary Magdalene became a follower of Jesus when he
exorcised seven demons from her.
Perhaps most important, Mary Magdalene was present at Jesus's crucifixion and
was the first witness to his resurrection. On the third morning after Jesus's death,
she went to his tomb and found it empty. Jesus then appeared before her. At first
she did not recognize him, but he called out her name. Jesus instructed her to tell
the other disciples of the miracle.
The details of Mary's life are the subject of much debate. Some scholars claim
that Mary Magdalene is actually the same person as other women mentioned in
the Gospels. For instance, at one point a female sinner is mentioned who lived in
the house of Pharisee. This woman, whose sin may very well have been
prostitution, did not have a name, but beginning in the third and fourth centuries,
scholars began to allege that she was actually Mary Magdalene.
Another theoretical storyline of Mary's life is that she was Jesus's wife. Although
there is little evidence on either side of this debate, supporters claim that Jesus is
never explicitly said to be unmarried. Mary was closer to him than any other
disciple, and it would have been very rare for a Jewish man of the time to be
traveling and teaching while single. On the other hand, there is little evidence to
suggest she was his wife and that being an unmarried teacher would not be too
outlandish, considering Jesus's revolutionary worldview.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. The tradition of giving painted Easter eggs on Easter may come from an
interaction between Mary Magdalene and the Roman Emperor Tiberius
CaesarAugustus. Due to Mary's presence atJesuss crucifixion and resurrection,
she wasgiven an audience with the emperor; and, declaring that Jesus had risen
from the dead, presented the emperor with an egg. The emperor responded that
jesus's rising was as likely as the egg turning red, which it promptly did.
2. Mary has been canonized a saint in the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox,
andAnglican churches.

WEEK 19

MONDAY, DAY I
The Peace of Westphalia
In the winter of 1648, exhausted by thirty years of war and devastation, the
major European powers met in the German province of Westphalia to hammer
out a peace treaty. The Thirty Year's War had started out as a religious dispute
between Catholics and Protestants in Germany. At Westphalia, the European
powers decided that religion simply wasn't worth fighting about anymore. Each
state, they agreed, should be allowed to choose its own religion and determine its
own foreign affairs. No longer would rival European princes try to impose their
own version of Christianity on their neighbors.
More important, the treaty enshrined the principle of national sovereignty that
has guided foreign affairs until the present. Prior to 1648, the rulers of
Germany's various regions reported to the Holy Roman Emperor. But it was
never clear-especially in matters of religion-who really had the final say, the
individual princes or the emperor. The treaty made it clear that individual
German states, not the far-off emperor, were sovereign. Stripped of most of its
power, the ancient Holy Roman Empire finally expired in 1806, just over a
thousand years after Charlemagne's coronation as the first emperor in 800 AD.
The concept of national sovereignty ended religious bickering and helped
stabilize Europe, but it did not end war. European princes simply found other
reasons, besides God, to fight. Indeed, some critics have argued that by giving
states total say over what happens within their borders, the treaty only lead to
more rivalry between European countries and contributed to the disunity of
Europe. The notion of sovereignty, they claim, has also given world leaders an
excuse to ignore horrible human rights abuses in other countries. For better and
for worse, the concept of national sovereignty remains central to international
affairs today.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Treaty negotiations were actually held in two separate towns, one for
Protestants and anotherfor Catholics, because the two camps refused to meet
with each other directly.
2. Adolph Hitler famously referred to the Nazi regime as the German "Third
Reich."In his reckoning, the first Reich was the Holy Roman Empire and the
second was the short-lived monarchy headed by the Kaiser from 1871 until
1918.
TUESDAY, DAY 2
Candide
The short novel Candide (1759) is the great satirical work of the Enlightenment,
the intellectual and rational movement that swept Europe from roughly 1650 to
1800. Written by Francois-Marie Arouet, better known by the snappier pen name
Voltaire, Candide skewers organized religion, the aristocracy, and the ideas of
several Enlightenment philosophers.
The Enlightenment produced a mind-boggling array of illustrious writers and
thinkers, but none had as incisive a wit or as keen an eye for satire as Voltaire.
Born in 1694 in Paris, he demonstrated his gift for parody from a young age.
Frequenting the Parisian salons with other intellectuals, known as philosopher,
he espoused rationalism and attacked long-standing religious and political
institutions. Voltaire's audacity got him into trouble in his early twenties, when
he angered the duke of Orleans. He was exiled and then imprisoned upon his
return to Paris. After his release, he was imprisoned yet again before leaving for
another exile in England in 1726.
After a prolific three decades of plays, novels, and essays, Voltaire penned the
now-famous farce Candide. The title character is an extraordinarily naive young
man who grows up in the household of a German baron. He is schooled by the
tutor Dr. Pangloss, who believes firmly that the world in which they live is le
meilleur des mondes possibles-"the best of all possible worlds." After the baron
banishes Candide from his home for falling in love with his daughter,
Cunegonde, Candide travels throughout Europe. A ludicrous string of hardships
and suffering ensues: Cunegonde sees her family killed by Bulgar hordes and
then is sold into sex slavery, Pangloss contracts syphilis and is later hanged, an
earthquake flattens the city of Lisbon, and Candide himself is repeatedly
flogged. Nonetheless, both he and his tutor remain faithful to their blindly
optimistic worldview, believing that tout est au mieux"everything is for the best"
Candide is a merciless jibe at the philosophies of Voltaire's contemporary
Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, who was renowned for his thorough optimism.
Though Voltaire was not necessarily pessimistic, he saw Leibniz's beliefs as so
optimistic as to be foolish-idle philosophical speculation that ignored the reality
of the world. Accordingly, at the end of Voltaire's novel, Candide has a
revelation of sorts and rejects Pangloss's teachings. He decides instead that the
way to achieve fulfillment is to "cultivate one's garden"-in other words, to
engage in practical pursuits that create tangible benefit.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Voltaire counted
amonghisfriendsandacquaintancesawiderangeofEuropeanluminaries,fromFrederick
the Great to Jonathan Swift, from Catherine the Great to Casanova.
2. American composer Leonard Bernstein adapted Candide into a comic operetta
in 1956. It has remained popular and is performed frequently to this day.
WEDNESDAY, DAY 3
Rembrandt
Rembrandt van Rijn, the most important artist of the Dutch School, is best
known for his excellent and innovative portraits. Born in the Dutch town of
Leiden in 1606, he studied with Pieter Lastman in Amsterdam. After returning
home and setting up a productive workshop for several years, he moved back to
the capital in 1631 and remained there for the rest of his life.
In the early years of Rembrandt's career, he tried to work in the dramatic
Baroque style so popular at the time. He did not succeed in competing with other
baroque masters, such as Peter Paul Rubens. His paintings were not as idealized
as those of his Italian and Flemish contemporaries. In The Blinding of Samson
of 1636, for example, he depicted the biblical hero as defeated and pathetic,
something that so displeased the recipient of the painting, he returned it to the
artist.
In portraiture, especially of multiple figures, however, Rembrandt enjoyed
immediate success. In the Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Tulp (1632), for example, he
captured the expressions of various physicians reacting to the dissection being
performed in their midst. Previous group portraits of surgeons had shown the
men in a formal lineup. In 1642, Rembrandt received his most important
commission: a group portrait of a civic militia company. The painting, The
Company of Captain Frans Banning Cocq and Lieutenant Willem van
Ruytenburch, depicts the company preparing for a festive pageant rather than a
genuine battle. The work is more commonly known as The Night Watch, a title
stemming from a layer of dark varnish, since removed, that misled viewers into
thinking the picture depicted a night scene. Today the more than fourteen-foot
wide portrait can be seen in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam.
Rembrandt's style changed considerably over time. His representation of
emotion grew increasingly subtle and suggestive as he abandoned the
theatricality of his early days. His numerous self-portraits-more than sixty in all-
likewise reflected his development both as an artist and as an individual. His
early self-conscious poses and fancy attire gradually gave way to the weary
dignity and wisdom of an experienced master.
After a series of financial crises, Rembrandt withdrew somewhat from the public
realm. Nevertheless he continued to receive important commissions, such as The
Syndics of the Cloth Guild (1662) in which five fabric inspectors look up as if
their conference has been interrupted by the viewer.
Rembrandt was also a skilled printmaker. He experimented with a variety of
techniques, papers and inks, and reworked his copper plates so that many of his
prints are actually one of a kind.
Since Rembrandt had a large studio and many assistants who worked in his style,
many works were erroneously attributed to him after his death. In 1968, a team
of Dutch art historians formed the Rembrandt Research Project, the goal ofwhich
was to weed out the false attributions. The project concluded that only about 350
of Rembrandt's paintings have survived.
THURSDAY, DAY 4
Gravity
Gravity is a great mystery of the universe. The theory behind gravity is that
every mass in the universe pulls on every other mass, and the strength of that
pull is affected by distance. The greater the mass, the greater the pull. The
greater the distance, the less the pull. But why does every object in the universe
pull on every other object? No one knows.
In everyday speech, mass and weight are used interchangeably, but they are
really quite different. Mass measures the amount of material in an object. A
pillow and a paperweight might have the same mass, although they are different
sizes. The paperweight is simply more dense than the pillow; the material inside
the paperweight is packed more tightly.
Weight measures the force exerted on an object in a gravitational field. Mass
does not change due to location, but weight can change depending on the
environment. A mass on the surface of the earth experiences a pull from the
planet of 9.8 meters per square second. If the same mass were taken to the
surface of the moon, the object would actually weigh less because the moon is
less massive than earth. The moon has one-sixth the gravitational pull, so the
object would weigh one-sixth as much. In other words, a 150-pound man would
weigh only 25 pounds on the moon.
Our bodies are designed to exist under the force of gravity from the earth. When
astronauts experience weightlessness in space-more correctly called
microgravity-they experience nausea, disorientation, headaches, loss of appetite,
and congestion. They become spacesick. Normally, the blood that flows into
your legs has to resist gravity to flow back up to your heart. In microgravity, the
blood rushes back up to your brain because there is no resistance. It's like
hanging upside down for a long time.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Astronauts have to exercise for several hours a day in space to prevent their
muscles from atrophying.
2. Sir Isaac Newton wrote the first mathematical formation ofgravity in 1687
3. The story that Newton conceived ofgravity after seeing an apple fall from a
tree is not true.
FRIDAY, DAY 5
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart
No composer's life or music is surrounded with more legend than that of
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791). Born in Salzburg, Austria, to Leopold
Mozart, a low-level court composer and teacher, Mozart spent most of his
childhood as a traveling prodigy, journeying to foreign courts and kingdoms in
Munich, Vienna, London, Paris, and Rome. He performed for kings, queens,
dukes, and popes, doing little tricks of musical memory and technical skill.
After a stint in Salzburg, Mozart spent much of his career in the court of Holy
Roman Emperor Franz Joseph II in Vienna. His breakthrough composition was
Abduction from the Seraglio (1781), an opera buffa, or comedic opera, the genre
in which Mozart would find himself most comfortable. He collaborated with
famed Viennese librettist Lorenzo Da Ponte on three successive operas, The
Marriage of Figaro (1786), Don Giovanni (1787), and Cosi fan tutte (1790). He
ended his career having written around forty symphonies, thirty piano concertos,
five violin concertos, and literally hundreds of overtures, quartets, and works for
flute, oboe, clarinet, chorus, and various other ensembles.
Mozart was a passionate man; he was utterly devoted to music, parties, good
food, good wine, billiards, sex, and gambling. He also had a seemingly unending
well of talent. Unfortunately, he and his capricious wife, Constanze, were very
irresponsible with their money. Despite producing almost all of his best works in
the last ten years of his life, Mozart had to beg money from his already
overextended creditors. He died, probably of rheumatic fever, after overworking
himself and not eating properly, at the age of thirty-five.
Today, Mozart's reputation endures as both an arrogant, immature genius and
also undoubtedly the greatest composer of the Classical era, if not of all time.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. In the nineteenth century, the romantics claimedMozart's legacy as their own,
making up myths abouthow he never got his due and starved for his music. In
reality, he was recognized as a genius during his lifetime, and he was one of the
highest paid composers of the era.
2. Mozart composed his first symphony when he was eight and his first opera
when he was twelve.
3. Mozart's sister Nannerl was a child prodigy pianist, but she was probably
never able to develop her own talents because she was a girl.
4. When Mozart died, his widow, Constanze, married a Danish diplomat whose
tombstone reads, "Here Rests Mozart's Widow's Second Spouse."
SATURDAY, DAY 6
Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz
Born in Leipzig, Germany, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716) began his
university studies at the age of fourteen, and he completed his doctorate at the
remarkably early age of twenty-two. Rather than become an academic, Leibniz
entered the service of various German nobles, working at different times as a
librarian, diplomat, engineer, and courtier. This variety of occupations mirrored
the variety of Leibniz's intellectual interests. In addition to major and lasting
work in philosophy, theology, and mathematics, Leibniz made significant
contributions to chemistry, physics, logic, medicine, botany, optics, history,
linguistics, jurisprudence, philology, and diplomacy. Not since Aristotle has a
major philosopher contributed to so many different branches of knowledge.
In the realm of philosophy, Leibniz was a rationalist. His overarching project
was to defend the principle of sufficient reason: that for every true proposition,
there is a reason why it is true, rather than false.
Because Leibniz believed there was a reason for everything, he believed there
must be a reason why God chose to create the world this way, rather than some
other way. The reason, Leibniz argued, is that this world is the best of all
possible worlds. That is the argument Leibniz made in the only book he ever
published, 7heodicy.
In a shorter work called Monadology, Leibniz put forth an unusual theory. He
suggested that the world consists of an infinite number of point-sized immaterial
things called monads. Our minds are monads, but not all monads are self-
conscious, as we are. Physical things, like tables and chairs, are not monads, nor
are they made up of monads. They exist because the monads perceive them; they
are the mutual dream of the monads The monad theory has few followers today.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Although Sir Isaac Newton (1642-1727) is widely credited with the discovery,
Leibniz also developed differential calculus.
2. Leibniz invented a mechanical calculator that could do simple arithmetic.
SUNDAY, DAY 7
The Last Supper
The Last Supper was the meal that Jesus had the night before he died. It is
believed by many, and suggested in the Gospels of Mark, Matthew, and Luke,
that this meal was a Passover Seder.
If it was a Seder, the Last Supper occurred on a Thursday, commemorated by
Holy Thursday, and Jesus was crucified on a Friday, commemorated by Good
Friday. The Gospel of John, however, indicates the meal was actually held a few
days before Passover, and the Eastern Orthodoxy accepts John's account.
Jesus shared this meal with his twelve apostles. He had foreseen the events that
would occur between the meal and his imminent death. He announced to his
apostles that one of them would betray him. One by one they each said, "It won't
be me." Finally, Judas Iscariot, having already agreed to hand Jesus over to the
Sanhedrin, said this as well, and Jesus told him, "Yes, it will be you"
While eating bread and drinking wine, Jesus told his disciples, "This is my body"
and, "This is my blood." He said he would not be able to consume these things
again until the Kingdom of Heaven arose, and he instructed the apostles to
similarly consume bread and wine in remembrance of him-the origin of the
Eucharist. The chalice that Jesus used to drink wine during the Last Supper is
believed by some to be the Holy Grail, said to hold miraculous powers. This
same chalice was used by Joseph ofArimathea to catch Jesus's blood as it
dripped from his crucified body.
Finally Jesus predicted at the meal that Peter would deny, on three separate
occasions, ever having associated with him. Peter exclaimed that he would rather
die than disown Jesus. However, after Jesus was convicted of blasphemy before
the Sanhedrin, three people approached Peter as he tried to flee the town. Each
accused him of knowing Jesus, and he denied it three times. After realizing what
he had done, Peter wept from shame.

WEEK 20

MONDAY, DAY I
Louis XIV of France
King Louis XIV inherited the crown in 1643 when he was only four years old
and ruled France for a staggering seventy-two years. During his long reign, the
monarch, nicknamed the Sun King, expanded France's power in Europe and
consolidated his own power at home. Ruling from his magnificent palace at
Versailles, Louis XIV built a centralized, absolute monarchy that wielded power
unparalleled in French history.
During his reign, Louis scattered new palaces across France and expanded
Versailles into the most opulent home in Europe. Arts and sciences flourished
during his reign and France's borders expanded.
Louis was said to have declared: " l'etat, c'est moi"-"I am the state" The
traditional checks on royal dominance in Francethe clergy and the nobility-ceded
much of their authority to the ambitious king in Paris. Louis broke the power of
France's squabbling nobles by inviting them to Versailles. There, they became so
preoccupied with court intrigue and politics, they didn't have time to organize
any trouble. Louis also forced the pope to give him more control over the
Catholic Church in France. He ordered the persecution of Protestants and Jews
to foster religious unity.
During the seventeenth century, other European countries, particularly Sweden,
followed France's example by creating absolute monarchies. This form of
government swept away many of the last vestiges of feudalism, but it also lead
to tyrannical behavior. This behavior led to the bloody Revolution in 1789.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. The US state ofLouisiana, a former French possession, is named after Louis
XIV.
2. Louis associated himself with Apollo, the Greek god of the sun. His bedroom
at Versailles was called the Apollo chamber.
TUESDAY, DAY 2
Postmodernism
The term postmodernism is notoriously difficult to define, whether in reference
to literature, art, or anything else. This is partly because postmodernism is not so
much a coherent style itself, but a reaction against an existing
movementmodernism. In general, postmodern literature features the self-
conscious blurring of different genres and styles, exploration of new or neglected
perspectives, and mixing of high and low art forms, often marked by irony and
humor. The timeframe of the movement is vague, but it is generally seen as
beginning around the 1940s.
During the first half of the twentieth century, modernist authors had investigated
questions of perspective and subjectivity. Many concluded that secure truths did
not exist and that the world was therefore hopelessly fragmented. Most authors
viewed this condition as the tragic result of human alienation in post-Industrial
society. But many writers of the younger generation-the postmodern generation-
believed otherwise, contending that this fragmentation presented an opportunity
for exploration and new insight.
Postmodern writers addressed this opportunity in many ways. Some utilized
comedy and irony: Thomas Pynchon's The Crying of Lot 49 (1966) revels in
self-consciously empty symbolism and false meaning, making it a source of
humor rather than tragedy. Other writers blurred or broke down traditional
barriers between genres: Truman Capote's In Cold Blood (1965) interprets a real
news story about two murderers using novelistic dialogue and themes,
effectively creating the new genre of journalistic fiction. And many writers
focused on the disaffection of the individual in modern society: Don DeLillo's
White Noise (1985) examines the absurd information overload and material
excess of contemporary America.
Likewise, different writers took different tacks in exploring questions of
perspective. Some, such as Toni Morrison and Maxine Hong Kingston, gave
voice to minority viewpoints they believed the modernists had ignored. Others
applied new perspectives to the retelling ofexisting stories. Jean Rhys's Wide
Sargasso Sea (1966), for instance, tells the backstory of a character from Jane
Eyre. Italo Calvino's Invisible Cities (1972) revisits the legend of Marco Polo
through the lens of modern urban theory. And Tom Stoppard's Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern Are Dead (1966) goes so far as to reinterpret Hamlet. Fascinating
and often audacious experimentation of this sort has continued throughout the
past decades, leading many people to claim that the era of postmodern literature
is not yet over.
ADDITIONAL FACT
1. There is no one typicalpostmodern author. Among many others, Umberto Eco,
PaulAuster, Salman Rushdie, John Barth, William Gaddis, Jeannette Winterson,
Vladimir Nabokov, Gabriel Garcia Mdrquez, Philip K Dick, and Michael
Ondaatje have all been labeled postmodern.
WEDNESDAY, DAY 3
Girl with a Pearl Earring
The Dutch art historian Ludwig Goldscheider referred to Jan Vermeer's Girl with
a Pearl Earring as the "the Mona Lisa of the North."
Set against a dark background, the girl turns her head, and with lips slightly
parted she glances out of the painting. Her eyes and mouth are delicately
accented with flecks of white and pink. The light reflecting off her teardrop
pearl earring is rendered with a thick flake ofimpasto. Her simple golden dress
betrays no indication of time or place but the turban-like sash around her head
grants her a touch of the exotic. Both reveal Vermeer's skill at rendering folds
of drapery.
The Girl with a Pearl Earring is one of only three or four bust-length figures that
Vermeer painted. Most likely it was conceived as a tronie, a type of painting also
done by Rembrandt, in which character or expression take precedence over the
exact likeness of an identified individual. It may also have been designed as a
pendant, or companion piece, to Vermeer's Study of a Young Woman, the so-
called Wrightsman Girl at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.
Some people have conjectured that the model for the picture was Vermeer's
eldest daughter, Maria; others have speculated that it was Magdalena, the
daughter of Vermeer's patron Pieter van Ruijven. Tracy Chevalier, author of the
best selling novel, Girl with a Pearl Earring, imagined the girl as Griet, a maid
with whom Vermeer fell in love.
The mysterious identity of the woman has contributed a great deal to the aura of
the work, which was publicized only in 1881, when art collector Arnoldus
Andries des Tombes bought it at auction for two guilders. In his will, he
bequeathed the work to the Mauritshuis, in The Hague, where it has been on
display since des Tombes's death in 1902.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
As art critic Jan Veth poignantly stated, the painting of the Girl with the Pearl
Earring looks as though it were "blended from the dust of crushed pearls."
1. In Quiet Light, a collection ofpoems based on the paintings of Vermeer by
Marilyn Chandler McEntyre, includes a poem entitled "Girl with a Pearl
Earring."
2. In 1994, the painting underwent extensive restoration before being sent to
Washington for a major retrospective of Vermeer's work.
THURSDAY, DAY 4
Vaccines
Vaccines prepare the body to fight against a disease. They usually consist of
either weakened or dead germs, lesser forms of the disease itself. When the
immune system encounters the weakened germ, it makes specialized antibodies
that easily vanquish the disease. Later, if the body encounters the real disease, it
"remembers" the antibodies that it made earlier and easily fights off the illness.
Vaccines were invented during the height of the European smallpox epidemic in
1796. An English country doctor named Edward Jenner noticed that milkmaids
would sometimes get cowpox, a lesser form of smallpox, from handling cows.
These same milkmaids seemed resistant to smallpox. On a hunch, Jenner took
infected fluid from the hand of a milkmaid and injected it into an eight-year-old
farm boy. The boy came down with cowpox but quickly recovered. Jenner then
injected the boy with smallpox, and he did not become sick. He concluded that
cowpox could protect us from smallpox, and the first vaccine was, in fact, the
cowpox virus. The word vaccine comes from the Latin vacca, or cow.
Vaccines have protected humans from some of the world's most deadly diseases-
measles, mumps, rubella, tuberculosis, whooping cough, and smallpox.
Interestingly, not everyone has to receive an injection to be protected from a
disease. The principle of herd immunity holds that if enough people in a
population receive a vaccine, they will act as barriers to the spread of the
disease. Although the specific number varies from disease to disease,
vaccinating 90 percent of a population is, in most cases, tantamount to
vaccinating the whole population.
Certain groups are more likely to spread disease than others. In the United
States, school-age children are the most likely to spread disease because they
have such close proximity to each other. A study from Emory University found
that inoculating just 30 percent of schoolchildren reduced the chances of a
community-wide flu epidemic from 90 percent to 65 percent. If 70 percent of the
children were inoculated, the chance of an epidemic dropped to 4 percent.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Both the Protestant and Catholic churches initially objected to vaccines.
Timothy Dwight, a former president of Yale University once said, If God had
decreed from all eternity that a certain person should die of smallpox, it would
be d frightful sin to avoid and annul the decree by the trick of vaccination."
2. Herd immunity applies only to diseases that are passed from person to person.
For example, herd immunity does notprotectfrom tetanus, which is contracted
when an open woundcomes in contact with contaminated materials.
FRIDAY, DAY 5
Mozart's Requiem Mass
During the last ten years of his life, starting around 1782, Wolfgang Amadeus
Mozart became deeply interested in the contrapuntal composition styles of
Johann Sebastian Bach and George Frederic Handel. He studied manuscripts of
Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier and The Art of the Fugue, both didactic pieces
meant to explore the possibilities of instruments and musical forms.
With Bach's composition techniques in Mozart's ears, he began work on his
Requiem (1791), a setting of the Mass designed especially for a funeral. Its
opening chorus, along with the full choral settings of the Lachrymosa and
Confutatis, contain dark, powerful passages with intertwining, vaguely fugal
arrangements that strongly recall Bach. The textured complexity of the Requiem
demonstrates Mozart's deep emotional investment in the piece and suggests he
explored the darker side of his own nature to produce it. The circumstances
under which it was written are appropriately macabre.
The piece was solicited by a stranger dressed in gray who came to Mozart's
Vienna home in July 1791. After Mozart's death, it was revealed that this
stranger was actually an amateur musician named Count Franz von Walsegg,
who wanted Mozart to write the piece so that he could put his name on it and
pass it off as his own. Unaware of this fraud, Mozart wrote in his letters that he
was haunted by this strange patron and spent far too much time on the Requiem
than he should have. Mozart was in very poor health to begin with, probably
because of his poor eating habits and restless lifestyle. After a trip to Prague to
conduct the premiere of his final opera, The Clemency of Titus, Mozart died
after one last day's work on the Requiem, a piece that would, profoundly, be his
own death Mass.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. A pupil ofMozart's named Franz Siissmayr vowed to finish the piece, and he
did, based on sketches of bass lines that Mozart had laid out at the start of the
final Lachrymosa section.
2. In Peter Shaffer's film version ofMozart's life, Amadeus, Mozart's colleague
Antonio Salieri, an Italian composer who was in constant competition with
Mozart for commissions, is depicted as being the masked stranger who
requested the piece. This is a brilliant dramatic idea, but it's historical fiction.
3. On December 4, 1791, the night before Mozarts death, the composer
summoned his singer friends to his bedside to rehearse the individual parts
ofthe Requiem.
SATURDAY, DAY 6
Time
Since Aristotle, philosophers have tried to understand the nature of time. After
the work of Sir Isaac Newton (1643-1727), many believed time is a thing with
manyparts. In other words, there are individual "times." For these philosophers,
to say an event happened at a particular time is to mean that the event filled that
part, or unit, of time.
Gottfried Willhelm Leibniz (1646-1716) argued against the Newtonian outlook.
For Leibniz, there were events, which happen before, after, or simultaneously
with one another. Time is merely the way we organize these relations in our
minds. It is not an additional thing distinct from the things that stand in these
relations.
Against Leibniz, Immanuel Kant argued that time was neither a thing that exists
in itself, nor an order of relations among things that exist in themselves. Kant
insisted time is merely a way in which our minds organize the experiences we
have. For Kant, things that exist in themselves, outside of our minds and
independently of us, are not in time.
Another realm of philosophical investigation is how human beings experience
time. According to ordinary idiom, time flows. But does it? Whenever you say,
"Now is the present," no matter when you say it, you say something true. In
other words, the present is simply when you are. Some philosophers believe this
is because you and I are special; we live at the present. According to these
philosophers, time does flow: First, some time is the past, then it is the present,
and later it is the future.
Other philosophers believe that "now" is like "here"; "here" does not refer to any
particular place, just the place you happen to be when you say it. These
philosophers believe you and I are not special. Time does not flow. It just has
many parts, like space. We live in one part of time, which to us is the present,
just like our physical location is our "here."
ADDITIONAL FACT
1. Some philosophers believe that all times past, present, and future-exist
simultaneously. According to these philosophers, there are dinosaurs, cavemen,
and dodo birds just not where we exist.
SUNDAY, DAY 7
The Crucifixion
Around 30 BC, Jesus of Nazareth was angry at what he felt was impurity within
the Jewish religious establishment. At the Temple in Jerusalem, moneychangers
and merchants had set up shop in what was supposed to be the holiest of places.
Leading his followers to the Temple during Passover, Jesus overturned tables,
causing a visible disturbance.
In response, Joseph Caiaphas, the high priest of the Sanhedrin, the Jewish high
court, arrested Jesus on charges of blasphemy. It is believed that Caiaphas was
able to arrest Jesus because Jesus was identified, and betrayed, by one of his
apostles, Judas Iscariot. When Jesus refused to cooperate, the Sanhedrin turned
him over to the Roman prefect Pontius Pilate.
At this point, Pontius Pilate sentenced Jesus Christ to death by crucifixion. The
reason for that harsh sentence is a matter of enormous debate. The most widely
accepted view is that Pilate made the decision himself, either for fear that Jesus
might foment a political rebellion, or simply out of mere brutality.
Regardless of how the decision was made, Pilate gave the order to execute Jesus,
labeling him "King of the Jews." Jesus was forced to carry his cross (likely
weighing more than 100 pounds) during his journey between the prison and
Calvary, the site of his execution. Although Jesus is often depicted as carrying
the entire cross, he probably carried only the horizontal piece, while the vertical
stake was permanently fixed in the ground at the execution site. The site of
Calvary was located somewhere outside of Jerusalem and was most likely a
cemetery that the Romans used to quickly bury their victims.
While Jesus was hanging from the cross, Joseph of Arimathea approached and,
using the same chalice that Jesus drank from during the Last Supper, caught
some of Jesus's dripping blood. This chalice is known as the Holy Grail. After
Jesus died, Joseph removed Jesus's body and buried it in his own tomb.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. In years following the crucifixion, Pontius Pilate was removed from his post
for excessive brutality.
2. The Catholic Church did not officially condemn the belief that the Jews killed
Jesus until the Vatican II accords in 1965.
3. Despite claims that thousands ofpeople were crucified during the Roman
Empire, only one crucified body has ever been discovered. Most victims were
simply left on their crosses to decay.

WEEK 21

MONDAY, DAY I
Peter the Great
Tsar Peter the Great (1682-1725) ruled Russia from 1696 to 1725 transforming
the nation into a major world power during his forty-three-year reign. He
governed as an absolute monarch, patterning himself after Louis XIV of France.
He even built a glittering new palace at his capital of Saint Petersburg, intended
to surpass even Versailles.
Prior to Peter's accession, Russia was not quite European and not quite Asian.
Russians were Christians. But their sprawling country, larger than all of Europe
combined, bordered the ancient Asian empires of China and Persia. Much of
Russia had been a part of the old Mongol Empire.
Peter moved Russia squarely into the European camp. He moved the Russian
capital from Moscow to Saint Petersburg, a city he founded on the Baltic Sea.
He sought closer ties with European countries, adopted European customs in
dress, and was the first Russian leader to visit the West. Peter reorganized the
Russian military and government to copy European standards.
The tsar himself was ruthless, hot-tempered, and hard-drinking. "A want of
judgment, with an instability of temper, appear in him too often and too
evidently," an English observer wrote in 1698. Peter was also a physical giant,
standing almost seven feet tall.
For the two centuries after Peter's death in 1725, the Russian Empire was a
major European power. However, the autocracy of the tsars and the continued
existence of serfdom, which was not abolished in Russia until 1861, prevented
the development of a strong Russian middle class. Peter's ancestors ruled Russia
until the revolution in 1917.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. To discourage facial hair, Peter imposed a tax of] 00 rubles on nobles who
wanted to wear traditional Russian beards and a tax of one kopek on
commoners.
2. After the communist Revolution in 1917, the Russian capital returned to its
ancient home ofMoscow. Saint Petersburg was renamed Leningrad in honor of
Vladimir Lenin, but the name reverted to Saint Petersburg after the collapse of
the Soviet Union in 1991.
3. Thepalace built by Peter is now the Hermitage museum in Saint Petersburg,
one ofthe largest art museums in the world.
TUESDAY, DAY 2
Brave New World
The genre of dystopian literature-fiction depicting a nightmarish, anti-utopian
future-was one of the major innovations of twentieth-century writing. The best
known novel in this category is George Orwell's 1984, which terrified Cold War-
era readers with its vision of a totalitarian political state. But today, the most
troubling and relevant work of dystopian literature is undoubtedly Aldous
Huxley's Brave New World, which envisions a nightmare society arising not
from political tyranny but from science and technology.
Published in 1932, Brave New World is shockingly prescient. The novel is set in
a futuristic England in which production of human embryos is tightly controlled
in governmentrun hatcheries. Each developing embryo is either coddled or
subjected to brutal chemical treatments so that it will grow-or be deliberately
stunted-to take its proper place in the rigid caste system that dictates a person's
status and role in society. At the highest rung of the social ladder are Alphas,
who are groomed for leadership and academia; at the lowest are Epsilons, who
perform only manual labor. All children are conditioned rigorously after they are
born, via schooling, hypnosis, and other psychological indoctrination. As
always, they remain segregated by class.
Although this system produces great social stability, it does so at the cost of
individual humanity and free will. This dehumanization has tragic consequences
when a "savage" from a remote part of the American Southwest-one of the few
human beings raised outside the system-is brought to London. He is fascinated
to be part of this "brave new world" he has heard so much about, but his
transition to his new surroundings goes less than smoothly.
Brave New World is one of the few science-themed novels that also has enduring
literary relevance. Long a staple of English classrooms and book clubs, it has
attracted especially close attention in recentyears because ofthe growing
attention paid to bioethics and cloning. Indeed, Huxley's predictions about the
fearsome potential of science, which seemed unthinkably remote in his own day,
appear ominously imminent just decades after he wrote them.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. The novel's title comes from Shakespeare's The Tempest, in which the
shelteredMiranda, upon first seeing humans from the outside world, exclaims,
"0 brave new world/ That has such people in't!"
2. Huxley's grandfather, a prominent biologist, had been one of the foremost
proponents of Charles Darwin's theories of evolution and natural selection.
3. In 1958, Huxley published the essay Brave New World Revisited, arguing that
the world was indeed moving closer toward the dystopian future he predicted
in Brave New World.
WEDNESDAY, DAY 3
The Taj Mahal
The Taj Mahal in Agra is considered by many people to be the most beautiful
building in the world. The white marble mausoleum was built between 1631 and
1648 to house the tomb of Mumtaz Mahal, the wife of the Mughal ruler, Shah
Jahan, who died while giving birth to her fourteenth child.
The complex consists of five parts: a formal gateway, a garden, the mausoleum
itself, a mosque on the west, and an assembly hall on the east, which was erected
for the sake of symmetry. A long reflecting pool divides the area in half and
mirrors the tomb from the ideal viewing point at the front gate.
The identity of the architect responsible for the Taj Mahal is not entirely clear.
Some attribute the design to Geronimo Veroneo, an Italian working in the
Mughal court. More conclusive evidence points to the Persian architect Ustad Isa
Khan Effendi, who apparently assigned the details of the building to his pupil
Ustad Ahmad. The model for the design was Sultan Hasan's mausoleum in
Cairo.
Construction of the complex took more than seventeen years and required
20,000 workers. The tomb purportedly cost thirty million rupees at a time when
the price of gold was fifteen rupees per tola (11.66 grams). Material, which
included twenty-eight types of precious and semi-precious stones, was brought
from all over Asia. The white marble was quarried in Makrana in Rajasthan.
The tomb rests on a white marble plinth, 100 meters square. The entire building
(minus the minarets) is as wide as it is tall. The dome rises 44.4 meters and is
exactly the same height as the facade. A second smaller dome is placed on the
inside of the balloon external dome. The only asymmetrical element is the tomb
of Shah Jahan, placed at the side of his wife. Inlaid in stone at the main entrance
are quotations from the Koran, inviting the "pure in heart" to enter the "gardens
of Paradise."
According to legend, Shah Jahan-who spent his old age imprisoned by his son-
planned to build a second, black marble tomb for himself on the other side of the
river.
Time has taken its toll on the building. At one point, Lord William Bentinck, a
British governor in India, proposed selling it off for its materials. In 1983, it was
named a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Indian author Rabinadrinath Tagore called the Taj Mahal "a tear on the face of
eternity."
2. The name Taj Mahal means "Crown Palace."
THURSDAY, DAY 4
Marie Curie
When people talk about women in science, the first name that always comes up
is Marie Curie (1867-1934). And with good reason. She was not only the first
woman to win a Nobel Prize, she was the first person to ever earn two Nobel
Prizes.
Marie Curie won her first Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903 for her research into
radioactivity. Ten years earlier in Paris, Curie and others had been researching
the properties of uranium. She noticed uranium emitted rays that could travel
through wood and flesh. But curiously, no matter what she did to the uranium-
heating it, cooling it, or combining it with other elements-the amount of emitted
rays remained constant in relation to the mass of the uranium. Curie concluded
that the emission of rays, or radioactivitya term she coined-was a property of
atoms, not the product of a chemical reaction.
Curie next began to examine pitchblende, a material rich in uranium. The
pitchblende gave off more radiation than could be accounted for by uranium
alone. She and her husband Pierre succeeded in finding two new elements in the
pitchblende, both highly radioactive. One of them they named polonium, after
Marie's home country of Poland. The other they named radium, after the Latin
word for ray.
Curie won her second Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1911 for the discovery of
radium and polonium. To this day, she remains the only person other than Linus
Pauling to have won two Nobel Prizes in two different fields.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Marie Curie died from leukemia in 1934 after years ofmassive exposure to
radiation.
2. The following year her daughter Irene won the Nobel Prize for her discovery
ofartificial radioactivity.
3. Until her granddaughter had them decontaminated, Marie Curie's notes were
radioactive.
4. Marie Curie was the first woman ever to become d professor at the Sorbonne
in Paris.
FRIDAY, DAY 5
Mozart's Don Giovanni
With the international success of Mozart's Marriage of Figaro (1784), the
composer received another commission from the Prague Opera House. He
teamed up with librettist Lorenzo Da Ponte for a second effort, this time
choosing the legend of Don Juan, as told in Giovanni Bertati's 1775 play Don
Giovanni ossia Il convitato di pietra, as his subject.
The story is of an incorrigible rake and philanderer, Don Juan, whom Mozart and
his librettist turned into something of a sympathetic character. In doing so, they
mixed the genres of opera seria and opera buffa, so that in the end, Don
Giovanni is neither a morality play, a tragedy, nor a comedy-but rather,
something in between. It is for this reason that some historians think Don
Giovanni (1787) was poorly received in Vienna, a city whose audiences were
notoriously conservative and bound to musical conventions.
The music starts with Mozart's imperious, bombastic, minor-chord theme-a
hauntingly appropriate accompaniment to the first scene, in which Don Giovanni
kills a man. The opera alternates between the antihero's touching serenades,
absurd and farcical seductions, and the moralistic tragedies that befall him. In the
terrifying final sequence, the ghost of the murdered man drags Giovanni off to
hell because he refuses to repent. In terms of emotional impact, Don Giovanni is
probably Mozart's greatest work, and his unique stamp of brilliance is
unmistakable on the piece.
The new genre of opera represented by Don Giovanni was dubbed dramma
giocoso, and it enjoyed great success in every city but Mozart's own. By the time
the composer died, Don Giovanni was one of the most widely staged operas in
all of Europe.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. It is rumored that after seeing Don Giovanni, Emperor Franz Joseph told
Mozart that it had "too many notes, "to which the composer replied, `Just as
many as needed, Your Majesty."
2. While writing the libretto for Don Giovanni, Da Ponte holed up by himself in
a room in his patron's house. In the next room there was a constantly stocked
table of food and wine; and in a third room, a prostitute who was available for
inspiration at the ring ofa bell.
3. The opera premiered in Prague in 1787, Vienna in 1788, London in 1817, and
New York in 1826.
SATURDAY, DAY 6
Epistemology
Epistemology is the branch of philosophy that deals with knowledge. One major
project in epistemology that goes back to Plato is the attempt to define just what
knowledge is. Traditionally, philosophers have defined knowledge as true,
justified belief.
First, to say that knowledge is belief means that to know something, you must
believe it.
Second, knowledge must be true because you cannot really know anything that
is false. If something is false, you may very well believe it, and even believe you
know it. But, according to the philosophical definition, you don't really know it.
Third, real knowledge is justified, because your belief must have reasons. If you
pick a number from 1 to 1,000, for example 463, and a friend correctly guesses
463, did that friend know you had picked 463? Since he or she was merely right
by accident, it seems wrong to say he or she knew it. Knowledge cannot be
accidental-you must have reasons for forming some true belief in order for that
belief to count as knowledge.
Recently philosophers have questioned whether all true, justified beliefs count as
knowledge. Consider the following case: You are driving through the
countryside, and you see a barn. You form the belief, "This is a barn." It is
clearly a justified belief. It is also a true belief. You have, in fact, just seen a real
barn. However, unbeknownst to you, you are in Fake Barn County, where most
of the farmers don't build barns. They build the facades of barns.'Therefore, the
argument continues, it was not knowledge because had you seen a fake barn, you
would have formed a false belief. Therefore, not all true justified beliefs are
knowledge
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Examples like the fake barn story were first suggested by Edward Gettier in a
classic 1963 essay entitled "Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?"
2. Philosophers still debate what further condition must be added to truth and
justification for a belief to count as knowledge.
3. Other problems in epistemology include the problem of skepticism and the
problem ofinduction.
4. Gettier's original paper, which revolutionized epistemology, is only a few
pages long!
SUNDAY, DAY 7
The Resurrection
Three days after Jesus had been crucified and buried in the tomb of Joseph of
Arimathea, several women, including Mary and Mary Magdalene, went to his
grave to perform burial rites. When they arrived at the tomb, however, they
found it empty. The next day, Jesus began to appear before a number of his
disciples in order to show them that he had been resurrected. Approximately
forty days after he had arisen, Jesus ascended to heaven and left the terrestrial
world forever. Today, the ressurection is celebrated on Easter, and its story is
retold in the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.
The resurrection of Christ is a central pillar of Christianity for the majority of
Christians. Most members of the faith believe that Jesus's resurrection was an
actual event and that he did, in fact, rise from the dead.
Among many interpretations of the event is the one most commonly held, known
as the judicial view. It is believed that God was required to punish all of mankind
for their sins. However, to avoid doing so, God sent Jesus, who was pure, to bear
the burden of the sins committed by those people who accepted his teachings. In
exchange for their devotion, Jesus took all of those sins with him when he
ascended to heaven.
Although this view is widely held within Christianity, some Christians and many
nonChristians believe that the story of resurrection is actually an allegory. They
note that although the resurrection is retold in all four of the canonical Gospels,
none of them claim to have seen it firsthand. In fact, nowhere in the Bible does
anyone claim to have borne witness to the event. For liberal Christians who do
not believe Jesus actually rose from the dead, the story is still central to their
faith. It exemplifies hope.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. It should be noted that while all four canonical Gospels describe various
aspects of the resurrection, there are several contradictions among the four
works. While some argue this is evidence that the event never happened, others
believe itproves its truth. After all, it would be rare for four eyewitness
accounts to line up perfectly.
2. Several alleged non-Christian accounts of the resurrection exist, including that
of the Jewish historian Flavius josephus. Josephus wrote in 98 AD thatJesus
had arisen. However, the authenticity of this passage is questionable because it
was edited by Christians at some point.
3. Alternative explanations for jesus's absence from his tomb include: Jesus was
buried in a shallow grave and his corpse was eaten by animals, his disciples
stole his body or, even less widely believed, Jesus did not die on the cross, but
merely fainted. He was later resuscitated in his tomb and went on to live again.
MONDAY, DAY I
Benjamin Franklin
Benjamin Franklin (1706-1790), the most famous and influential American of
the eighteenth century, was an inventor, diplomat, journalist, and statesman. He
was a signer of both the Declaration of Independence and the United States
Constitution. In Franklin's long lifetime-he was born in Boston in 1706 when the
city was still ruled by the Puritans and died in Philadelphia in 1790 on the eve of
the industrial revolution-Franklin probably contributed more to the cultural and
political life of the young United States than any of his contemporaries. Franklin
helped discover electricity, published a successful newspaper, and invented the
Franklin stove. His reputation in his time, wrote John Adams, was "greater than
that of Newton, Frederick the Great, or Voltaire, his character more revered than
all of them." Some historians have coined him as the "first American."
Franklin was the fifteenth child of Josiah Franklin, a candle maker who
immigrated to Boston in the late seventeenth century. At the age of twelve,
Franklin went to work for one of his brothers, a newspaper publisher. His job
was to work with the presses, but soon he was writing articles for the newspaper
itself. Tired of working for his ungrateful brother, Franklin moved south to
Philadelphia at age seventeen. In Philadelphia, Franklin published newspapers
and humorous books, eventually becoming one of the city's most prominent
citizens. A man of infinite talent and curiosity, he started a hospital, an insurance
company, a philosophical society, and a university (currently the University of
Pennsylvania) -all still in existence today. He eventually retired from the printing
business and turned to science. Franklin helped explore the properties of
electricity and invented bifocals and the energy-efficient Franklin stove.
In the 1750s and 1760s, when the colonies began to tire of British rule, Franklin
was living in England. He helped represent the views of the Americans before
Parliament. Franklin returned from London convinced that the colonies had to
break free from England. In 1776, he signed the Declaration of Independence in
his hometown of Philadelphia. Franklin returned to Europe, representing the
fledgling United States in France, where he was a celebrity because of his
scientific discoveries. In the eyes of many Europeans, the young nation gained
credibility simply through its association with the great scientist. Franklin
returned to Pennsylvania and continued working almost until the day he died in
1790.
ADDITIONAL FACT
1. Among Franklin's inventions was a musical instrument made ofglass and
known as the armonica. Before its popularity faded in the nineteenth century,
the great Austrian composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart wrote two
compositions for Franklin's invention.
TUESDAY, DAY 2
Postcolonialism
Postcolonial literature refers to the body of works written by authors from
formerly colonized areas of the world, as well as works written about people
from those areas. The bulk of this literature has been written since the 1950s and
1960s, when the last major European colonies in Africa, Asia, Latin America,
and the Caribbean gained independence.
During the height of European imperialism in the late 1800s, European authors
tended to celebrate their countries' world dominance, extolling the alleged "white
man's burden" of civilizing the uncivilized. British writer Rudyard Kipling led
this charge with often overtly racist poems and novels. Gradually, however,
works such as Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness (1899) and E. M. Forster's A
Passage to India (1924) cast a more critical eye on Europe's colonial
involvement.
After decolonization swept through Asia and Africa following World War II,
authors in newly independent areas began to chronicle the cultural, social, and
psychological fallout. Many dwelled on questions of race, ethnicity, and national
identity. They also examined the political and religious tensions created when
Europe imposed artificial national boundaries on native peoples. Critics have
noted that postcolonial works often focus on the concept of otherness an idea
that theorist Edward Said famously articulated in Orientalism (1978) his
landmark treatise about the Western tendency to exoticize the East.
Postcolonialism is a sprawling movement, encompassing many regions and
authors. Notable works from Africa include Alan Paton's Cry, the Beloved
Country (1948) and Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart (1958); from Asia,
Graham Greene's The Quiet American (1955), Anita Desai's Games at Twilight
(1978), and Salman Rushdie's Midnight's Children (1981); and from the
Caribbean, V. S. Naipaul's A House for Mr. Biswas (1961), Jean Rhys's Wide
Sargasso Sea (1966), and Jamaica Kincaid's Annie John (1985).
Since the late 1980s, a new generation of postcolonial writers has taken the
reins, applying a fresh perspective to many of the same themes. A significant
number of these works, such as Hanif Kureishi's The Buddha of Suburbia (1990)
and Zadie Smith's White Teeth (2000), focus on non-Western immigrants living
in Britain or the United States. In general, they are more optimistic than their
often anguished postcolonial predecessors, accepting the uprooted migrant
condition as a reality of the modern world and exploring its positive and even
comic aspects.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Postcolonialism has been fruitfulground for women authors, many ofwhom
have explored feminist themes and the advancement of women in the context
of former colonies.
2. Although the bulk ofpostcolonial authors has come from minority
backgrounds, Caucasian writers, such as Athol Fugard andi M. Coetzee of
South Africa, have also played an important role.
WEDNESDAY, DAY 3
Hokusai
Katsushika Hokusai (1760-1849) is perhaps the most famous Japanese artist in
the West.
Born into a poor family, Hokusai was adopted by a mirror-maker who taught
him how to engrave. At the age of eighteen, Hokusai joined the workshop of
Katsukawa Shunsho, an artist renowned for his portraits of actors. Restless by
nature, Hokusai left Shunsho's shop in 1778 and began a wandering life. He
changed his name more than fifty times, and he did not call himself Hokusai
until the age offorty-six. At seventy-five, he referred to himself as Gakyo Rojin,
"Old Man Mad about Painting." In the course of Hokusai's life, he lived in more
than ninety houses. When one of his homes was destroyed by fire, he wrote in a
hokka (a traditional type of poem): "It has burned down: how serene the flowers
in their falling."
Seldom financially stable, Hokusai often resorted to publicity schemes. In one
instance, he challenged Tani Buncho to a contest determining who was the better
artist. As his entry, Hokusai first painted a broad sweep of blue on a huge piece
of paper, then dipped a chicken's feet in red paint and set it loose on the paper.
He called the result Maple Leaves on a River.
Over the years, Hokusai made more than of 30,000 drawings in 500
sketchbooks. Between 1814 and 1878, he published fifteen volumes of mangas
(rough sketches) depicting a broad range of real and imaginary subjects rendered
in a wide variety of styles. The last of the series appeared only in 1878, twenty-
nine years after his death.
Hokusai is best known, however, for his ukiyo-e, a technique that originated in
Tokyo. Ukiyo-e, which means "pictures of the floating world," are colored prints
in which different wood blocks are used in succession to apply different colors.
The most famous ukiyo-e by Hokusai is The Great Wave off Kanagawa from his
36 Views of Mount Fuji. The print, which depicts fishermen fighting the forces
of nature-not a traditional Japanese subject-was most likely influenced by Dutch
engravings that made their way into Japan.
When Hokusai's work was first seen in Europe, it made an enormous impact on
painters such as Paul Gauguin and Vincent van Gogh. James Whistler claimed
that Hokusai was the greatest artist since Velazquez. The exhibit Rembrandt, Van
Gogh and Hokusai, held in Amsterdam in 1951, did much to enhance the
Japanese master's reputation in the twentieth century.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Hokusai was one of the principal shunga (erotic print) masters of the Edo
period, as can be seen in his series Fukojuso.
2. In Fugaku Hyakkei (One Hundred Views ofMount Fuji, 1834-35) Hokusai
captured the famous peak in composite views from multiple perspectives, a
clear demonstration ofhis familiarity with the site.
3. Hokusai's largest work measures more than 200 square meters.
THURSDAY, DAY 4
Hypnosis
For more than 200 years, people have been trying to define hypnosis. Most of us
picture a man with a sinister handlebar moustache and a black top hat, swinging
a pocket watch in front of our eyes like a pendulum, telling us in an eerily calm
voice, "You are getting sleepy... " After a few moments, we imagine, he can
control our actions, our thoughts, and our memories.
Psychiatrists today understand hypnosis as a trancelike state of extreme
receptivity to suggestion. But it is more like guided daydreaming than mind
control. Although subjects of hypnosis often feel uninhibited, they will not do
anything that is against their will. Electroencephalograph (EEG) studies of
brainwaves during hypnosis show a boost of the low frequency waves associated
with sleep and dreaming. EEG studies also show a reduction in the high
frequency waves associated with full wakefulness, but they are not eliminated
entirely. This may explain the dreamy quality of hypnosis, but it does not
indicate that the subjects have become human puppets. They are still thinking for
themselves.
There are three basic ways to hypnotize someone. The first is called fixed-gaze
induction, which asks that the subject focus intently on an object (like a pocket
watch) in order to tune out the outside world. Although common practice in the
early days of hypnotism, this method is rarely used today. It simply doesn't work
on a large percentage of the population. The second method involves
bombarding the mind with rapid commands, "Stand up, sit down, blink, stand
up." It is the method of choice for stage performers and interrogators.
Psychiatrists use a third method, progressive relaxation, to focus and ease the
subject into a state of hypnosis. By talking in a soothing voice and suggesting
peaceful images, the psychiatrist creates an environment in which the subject can
learn to undo harmful habits, such as overeating and smoking.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Franz Anton Mesmer, an eighteenth-century physician from Austria, is
considered the father of modern hypnotism. He believed it to be a mystical
force that he called `animal magnetism."
2. The words mesmerism and mesmerize come from Mesmer's name.
3. Many experts consider driving and watching television to be states of
hypnosis.
4. People with active imaginations are the most likely to be susceptible to
hypnosis.
FRIDAY, DAY 5
Sonata Form
In terms of music theory, the classical period's most important legacy is the
establishment of sonata form as the most important compositional structure. It
remained the standard model for hundreds of short pieces and symphonic
movements for almost 200 years, extending its influence all the way to twentieth
century composers such as Bela Bart6k.
Sonata form is a musical construction used in individual movements within
longer pieces, or just for shorter stand-alone compositions. It developed from the
two-part, or binary, forms used in the baroque.
Baroque composers usually limited themselves to one emotion per piece or
movement, and they also usually developed only one main theme or motivic
complex per piece. Classical composers, on the other hand, liked to provide
contrasting themes and emotions in a given piece, and sonata form provided a
framework for them to do this. The form is as follows:
EXPOSITION: Sometimes preceded by a cursory introduction, this is the first
section of a movement or piece in sonata form. It presents the main thematic
material, usually in two parts: the primary theme, which is in the tonic, or home
key, and the secondary theme, usually in the dominant or a related key. These
two sections are often connected by a bridge that eases the modulation.
DEVELOPMENT: Harmonically unstable and with lots of modulation, this
section is where the composer can show off his or her versatility and talent by
taking the themes apart, reconstructing them, and recasting them in new
harmonic environments.
RECAPITULATION: Here, the expository themes come back and are restated
conclusively in the home key. It is often followed by a short coda, or ending
section.
In some ways, sonata form resembles the structure of an expository essay, which
is one of the reasons why many people see it as an outgrowth of the reason- and
logic-based spirit of the time. Whatever its origins, sonata form is one of the
most lasting contributions of the Classical composers.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Despite its prevalence, the term sonata form was not used by the composers
who invented it. Its first appearance was in the writings of music theorist
Joseph Riepel, sometime around 1755.
2. Beethoven was famous for expanding the coda ofhis symphonies into another
long, explorative, development section. His truegenius emerges in some
ofthese codas.
3. Also called compound binary form, sonata form is used in countless genres,
including symphonies, concertos, string quartets, and choral works, not just in
pieces that are actually called sonatas.
SATURDAY, DAY 6
John Locke
John Locke (1632-1704), the first major British Empiricist and one of the most
important political philosophers of modern times, was born in 1632 in Wrington,
England. Educated at Oxford, Locke was engaged in many of the major
philosophical, scientific, and political movements of his day. He was a founding
member of the English Royal Society-a scientific group whose most famous
member was Sir Isaac Newton-and played a significant role in the Protestant
opposition to King Charles II and his Catholic brother James.
Locke's major philosophical work is his Essay Concerning Human
Understanding. Locke argued that when human beings are born, our minds are
tabula rasa-blank slates. All of our knowledge subsequently comes from
experience. In Locke's psychology, ideas come from our sensory experience of
the world. We can compare ideas, we can combine them to make complex ideas,
and we can extrapolate general ideas from more specific ones. However, our
physical senses are the only place we can start, and this puts important limits on
what we can expect to know. For instance, Locke was skeptical about our ability
to know the underlying, real nature of things.
In political philosophy, Locke played an important role in the development of
social contract theory. According to Locke, human beings were originally in a
"state of nature," where there were no laws, and physical strength was the only
basis of authority. However, we created a social contract, whereby we ceded
certain natural rights to a government or other authority, in return for security
and other guarantees. Locke's important contribution was his argument that any
fair social contract must have certain qualities: It must respect its citizen's rights
to life, liberty, and property. If these rights are violated, Locke argued, we are
entitled to rebel against the governing authority, even the king.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. For Locke's involvement in a Protestant plot against the king and his brother,
Locke fled England for Holland. He returned to England in 1688, during the
Glorious Revolution.
2. Locke's ideas were the foundation of theAmerican colonists's Declaration of
Independence.
3. Ideas like Locke's social contract theory ofgovernment influenced the leaders
of the American Revolution.
SUNDAY, DAY 7
The Gospels
Gospel, meaning "good news," is most commonly used in reference to the four
Canonical Gospels of the New Testament. These four Gospels-the Gospel of
Matthew, the Gospel of Mark, the Gospel of Luke, and the Gospel of John-are
the main sources for Jesus's teachings as Jesus himself is not known to have left
anything in writing. The Gospels were each written between about 60 and 110
AD, most likely in Greek, though some people claim that Matthew was
originally written in Aramaic.
The order of authorship and the interplay between the four Gospels is very
complex. Matthew, Mark, and Luke all describe the story and teachings of
Jesus's life, covering many of the same events, while John focuses more on
Jesus's philosophical and theological ideas. Because Matthew, Mark, and Luke
each depict Jesus's life, it is thought that they may have used each other as
sources.
Today, it is most widely believed that Mark was written first and that Matthew
and Luke used Mark as a blueprint. It is also speculated that Matthew and Luke
used a second source, known simply as Q, which has never been discovered.
Mark does not begin with Jesus's birth, but rather picks up his life when he
begins teaching. Matthew and Luke tell the stories of Jesus's birth, John the
Baptist's teachings, Jesus's teachings, and Jesus's resurrection. John contains
many of the same stories, but often out of chronological order.
In addition to these four Gospels, many other noncanonical, or apocryphal,
Gospels exist. For the most part, these were written later than the first four and
therefore have been accepted only sporadically throughout the Christian world.
Many of these are criticized for making Jesus appear too magical. For instance,
one story tells of Jesus making a bird out of clay, then waving his hand bringing
the bird to life. Roman Catholics consider such accounts to be heretical.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Irenaeus ofLyons is credited with insisting that the New Testament contain
only four Gospels and no more. His reasoning? Four was the number ofwinds
as well as the corners ofthe earth.
2. The Gospel ofjohn is the major source for suggesting that the Jews were to
blame for jesus's death. Although the author of the Gospel was most likely
Jewish and his focus of blame was on specific Jewish leaders at the time, these
passages of the Gospel have been used against Jews in times ofpersecution.
3. Although the Gospels are a major part of the New Testament, they make up
only four oftee work's twentyseven books.
MONDAY, DAY I
George Washington
"First in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen."
-a eulogy at the funeral of George Washington
George Washington (1732-1799) was the military leader of the American
Revolution and the first president of the United States. Prior to the outbreak of
the Revolution in 1775, Washington was a prosperous Virginia plantation owner.
He had fought alongside the British in wars against the French and various
Indian tribes, but he soured on the crown's rule in the 1760s and early 1770s. By
the time the Revolution started, Washington was a committed patriot. The
Continental Congress unanimously chose Washington to lead the rebel army, and
he took command in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on July 3, 1775.
On paper, Washington's task seemed virtually impossible. In 1775, Great Britain
was the most powerful country in the world. Its well-trained troops and paid
mercenaries were among Europe's finest. Against such a foe, Washington could
hope only for few outright victories. Instead, Washington reckoned correctly that
he could wear the British down by avoiding outright defeats. No matter how
many troops Britain sent to its rebellious colonies, the colonists fought back.
Washington's persistence convinced France, Spain, and the Netherlands to ally
with the colonists. Eventually the British gave up. The Revolution was notable
for its relatively small toll in lives. Through the entire war against England, the
patriot army lost 6,824 men-a fraction of the casualties the United States would
suffer in later wars.
Washington's canny leadership made him immensely popular in the newly
independent country. But instead of seizing power, he retired to Mount Vernon,
his Virginia plantation. Washington finally agreed to run for president in 1789,
and he was elected without opposition.
As president, Washington's greatest legacy was what he didn't do. In office, he
purposefully set precedents to guide future presidents. He refused ostentatious
titles, instead insisting that in a republican country he should be called simply
"Mr. President." He refused to run for a third term in 1796, establishing an
unwritten rule that was observed by presidents until 1940, when Franklin D.
Roosevelt sought a third term. When Washington died in 1799, Americans
mourned the loss of"the father of his country."
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Twelve US presidents held the rank ofgeneral. World War II commander
Dwight D. Eisenhower was the last, serving from 1953 to 1961.
2. As president, Washington signed legislation establishing many of the basic
building blocks ofAmerican government. Laws signed by Washington in his
first term made the dollar the official US currency, established a site for the
nation's capital, and created a cabinet to give him advice.
3. Washington considered slavery immoral, but he owned slaves and rebuffed
suggestions during his lifetime that he free them as an example to others. In
Washington's will, however, he finally did so.
TUESDAY, DAY 2
Anton Chekhov
Anton Chekhov (1860-1904) was one of literature's great masters of the short
story and one of its finest dramatists. In several landmark plays and countless
miniature prose masterpieces, he mined remarkable stories from everyday life.
Although his works are by and large serious, they consistently walk the tightrope
between comedy and tragedy.
Chekhov was born into a debt-ridden family from southern Russia that had
purchased its freedom from serfdom just a generation earlier. As a medical
student in Moscow, Chekhov wrote short comic pieces to support his parents,
selling hundreds of them under a variety of pen names. He continued writing
after finishing his medical degree in 1884 and developed a large popular
following by his late twenties. As Chekhov gradually tackled weightier subject
matters and made his first forays into dramatic writing, he began to attract the
attention of literary critics.
The now-legendary Saint Petersburg premiere of Chekhov's The Seagull (1896)
was an unmitigated disaster. The play was falsely advertised as a comedy, and
when the audience started hissing, Chekhov fled the theater in humiliation-an
experience that nearly led him to abandon dramatic writing altogether. Later
productions of The Seagull, however, were well received, and Chekhov scored
another triumph when he revised one of his mediocre early plays into the
extraordinary Uncle Vanya (1897). He followed with The Three Sisters (1901)
and The Cherry Orchard (1904), also considered tragicomic masterpieces. These
plays feature generational conflicts and other family troubles, with onstage
dramatics kept to a minimum. The most important events happened offstage,
conveyed through dialogue rather than action.
Though Chekhov is most renowned for his plays, his short stories are brilliant
and arguably without equal. They unfold in a melancholy landscape of keenly
observed reality, populated by characters who are mired in self-pity over the
dullness and triviality of their everyday lives. The stories' plots usually are
minimal and misleadingly simple, with the most important elements hidden
under the surface and little or no resolution provided at the end. More than 200
in number, Chekhov's short stories were integral in establishing the short story as
the major literary form it is today.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Chekhov continued practicing medicine even at the height of his writing
career. In one well-known quip, he wrote, `Medicine is my lawful wife and
literature my mistress; when Iget tired ofone, I spend the night with the other."
2. Chekhov's plays became canonical in both British and American theater
almost immediately upon their translation into English in the 1920s. They are
still widely performed.
3. Russian critics and intellectuals often pressured Chekhov to make his works
more political. He always refused, believing that politicizing his work would
reduce its universality.
WEDNESDAY, DAY 3
Romanticism
The movement known as romanticism (1750-1850) arose largely in response to
neoclassicism. Whereas neoclassical artists placed great emphasis on the
enlightenment values of reason, objectivity, order, and science, romantic artists
were drawn to the realm offantasy, intuition, subjectivity, andemotion. Inspired
by the ardor that had spawned the American and French revolutions, romantics
celebrated rebellion and personal freedom over social convention. Dismayed by
the rapid growth of industrialization, they marveled at the wonders of nature and
the purity of simpler, more primitive cultures. In contrast to neoclassicists, who
preferred the clear lines and elegance of Greco-Roman art, romantics were
fascinated by the complexity of Gothic architecture as well as the mystique of
exotic cultures.
In England, romanticism appeared as early as 1749, when the novelist Horace
Walpole decided to renovate Strawberry Hill, his villa at Twickenham, with
Gothic motifs. Representative Romantic works of English painting include
George Stubbs's Horse Being Devoured by a Lion (1763), Henry Fuseli's The
Nightmare (1781), and William Blake's illustrations for his own books of poetry.
English Romanticism reached its height in the paintings of John Constable and
Joseph Mallard William Turner. In terms of architecture, the movement is best
reflected in the neo-Gothic Houses of Parliament, which were begun in 1836.
French romanticism owed a great deal to both the writings of Jean-Jacques
Rousseau and the French Revolution. Remarkable French painters of the period
include Jean-AugusteDominique Ingres, Theodore Gericault, and Eugene
Delacroix. The best example of French romantic architecture is Pierre Vignon's
church, Le Madeleine; within its neoclassical shell are three Byzantine domes.
Such conflation of historical styles characterizes much architecture of the period.
In Germany, the movement owed much to the struggling hero of Johann
Wolfgang von Goethe's Sorrows of Young Werther, published in 1774. Caspar
David Friedrich's Cloister Graveyard in the Snow (1817-19) and Philipp Otto
Runge's Times of the Day (1809) are typical of German Romanticism.
The style is best represented in America by the works of John Singleton Copley,
whose dramatic masterpiece Watson and the Shark (1778) was commissioned by
the survivor of the attack.
The greatest Spanish artist of the romantic era was Francisco de Goya.
THURSDAY, DAY 4
Cognitive Dissonance
In 1957, Leon Festinger, a social psychologist at Stanford University, published
Theory of Cognitive Dissonance, one of the most influential papers on human
behavior ever written. The theory is very simple. We all hold a variety of beliefs,
ideas, and thoughts, which scientists call cognitions. For the most part our
cognitions are unrelated to each other. For example, a love of opera has nothing
to do with who was elected president in 1980. But when our thoughts or actions
are related to each other, we feel a deep need for them to be consistent.
Contradictions result in a state of dissonance that the mind cannot tolerate. The
conflicting cognition or behavior must change to bring the brain back into a state
of equilibrium. Since thoughts are usually easier to change than behavior, we are
likely to alter our mindset.
Festinger gave the example of smoking. A man who smokes experiences
cognitive dissonance when he hears about the health risks. One solution is to
stop smoking. But since behavior is difficult to change, the smoker is more likely
to change his beliefs about smoking in order to reduce the stress of dissonance.
For example, he might choose to focus on the positive health aspects of smoking
such as tension relief and weight loss. He might say to himself, "If I stop
smoking, I'll gain weight, which is also bad for me" Alternatively, he could
compare the dangers of smoking to other everyday risks, like the risk of being in
a car accident. The smoker might think, "If people get on the road every day
without hesitating, why should I worry about lighting a cigarette?" Such
rationalizations allow people to keep their behaviors consistent with their beliefs,
reducing cognitive dissonance.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Fraternity hazing works on the principle of cognitive dissonance. Researchers
have found that the more humiliating the initiation ritual, the more freshmen
are likely to say that they enjoy beingpartofthegroup. Social psychologists refer
to this as the effort jnotification paradigm.
2. Economists attribute buyer's remorse to cognitive dissonance.
3. Festinger also found that ifpeople are paid to lie, they do not believe the lies.
But, ifthey volunteer to lie for free, they often believe what they are saying. If
they lie without the justification that they're being paid, they experience
cognitive dissonance. So they attempt to believe what they're saying.
FRIDAY, DAY 5
Mozart's Concerto No. 21 and Symphony No. 41
Mozart composed seventeen piano concertos in the latter half of his career. They
are considered to be the best examples of classical concerto literature. Many of
them utilize an adaptation of sonata form called sonata-ritornello form-a
combination of regular sonata form and the concerto-writing style of Vivaldi. In
this structure, the orchestra restates the themes played by the solo parts.
Sonata-ritornello form may have developed specifically for piano concertos as a
means of making sure the audience heard and understood the melodies. Those
melodies may have been difficult to hear because pianos did not have the volume
they do today.
Mozart's Concerto No. 21 is among the most brilliant of the seventeen. It has
sunny, pleasant motifs in the first movement, while the middle slow movement is
placid, beautiful, and often interpreted in a romantic or sentimental way. The
final movement has lots of flashy technical passages.
Mozart's Symphony No. 41, written in a regal C-Major, is often called the
"Jupiter Symphony" because of its grandiose first movement. It exemplifies
Mozart's ability to write within sonata form without sacrificing his immense
expressive talents. Loud trumpet and drums in the opening movement give the
piece a sense of triumph, and the final movement, which mounts a massive,
Bach-inspired fugue, manages at least six different themes that come together in
an explosive finale, all the while still maintaining the requirements of the sonata
structure.
Both of these pieces highlight the Classical style and sonata form at their most
mature and impressive. Pieces like these two lead many musicologists and
historians to insist that Mozart was the greatest composer who ever lived.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. The Kcatalog (i.e., K467, K551) was established in 1861 by German
musicologist Ludwig von Kochel as a way ofkeeping track ofMozart's works
and their dates of composition. Nowadays, a Mozart composition is rarely
mentioned without its accompanyingKochelnumber. Concerto No. 21 is K467,
1785.
2. No one knows exactly where the name Jupiter" came from, but Mozart did not
name his forty-first symphony as such. Mozart's son insisted that the name
came from Peter Salomon, the same impresario who commissioned Haydn's
London symphonies.
3. The lyric slow movement ofMozarts Piano Concerto No. 21 was used as the
soundtrack to a soppy 1967 romance film called Elvira Madigan. As a result, it
is often called "The Elvira Madigan"concerto, which is quite an unfortunate
label for such a powerful work.
SATURDAY, DAY 6
Personal Identity
Recall yourself as a child. Despite many qualitative differences-now you are
older, bigger, and, presumably, wiser-you are still the same individual as you
were as child. The child you and the adult you are the same person. The problem
of personal identity asks: Under what conditions is an individual at one time the
same person as an individual at another time? In other words, what kinds of
changes can a person undergo and continue to exist?
One possible answer is that a person is just a human organism, and so as long as
he or she remains the same human organism, he or she remains the same person.
But consider this thought-experiment: A scientist is going to remove your brain
and put it into his head. He is then going to remove his brain and put it in your
head. Finally, he is going to torture one of the resulting people. Before the
operation occurs, you are a given a choice: Based only on selfinterest, who
would you rather be tortured: The person who has your body and the scientist's
brain (A), or the person who has the scientist's body and your brain (B)?
If you believe you are just an organism, after this operation, you will still be A.
After all, the brain is just an organ, and an organism does not cease to exist just
because it undergoes an organ transplant. Therefore, if you opted to torture B,
you are implicitly assuming that you are not an organism, and that your identity
is determined some other way.
The importance of this thought-experiment is twofold. First, it shows that the
nature of identity over time is not obvious. At first we are tempted to assume that
we are just organisms, but thought-experiments lead us to question this
assumption. Second, the question about personal identity is linked to a larger
question about the self. What exactly do we care about when we say we are
acting out of self-interest? The thought-experiment suggests that self-interest is
connected to concern for our experiences and our memories, rather than our
bodies.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. John Locke argued that person A and person B are identical when they are
psychologically connected, most important, by memory.
2. Imagine a teleporter that disintegratedyou, and then beamed information to a
spacestation on Mars, where a person qualitatively indistinguishable from you
is constructed. Would you use this as a means of longdistance travel? Is the
person who emerges the same person as the one who entered?
3. What if the teleporter created two duplicates, rather than one? Would you
survive in that case? Which one would be you? Is it better for there to be two,
or just one, person who is connected to you in this way?
SUNDAY, DAY 7
Catholicism
The Roman Catholic Church is the world's largest Christian sect, with more than
1.2 billion members. Countries as diverse as Italy, Ireland, Spain, the Philipines,
Mexico, and Argentina are all almost completely Catholic.
The Catholic world is governed from Vatican City, the small independent state
within the confines of Rome. There, the Pope, who is also the Bishop of Rome
and thought to be the successor of Peter, leads the faith, with the aid of his
Cardinals. The Catholic world is divided into more than, 2500 dioceses, each
headed by a bishop. Within each diocese, each church is led by a priest or
deacon, completing the Catholic hierarchy.
Central to the Catholic faith is the practice of the Seven Sacraments. These are:
BAPTISM: Signifying the forgiveness of original sin, done by submerging or
splashing water on the believer.
CONFIRMATION: Signifying a second statement of faith for those who have
been baptized.
THE EUCHARIST: Eating the body and drinking the blood of Christ. Catholics
believe the bread and wine used in the ritual literally become flesh and blood.
PENANCE: Asking for the forgiveness of sins.
ANOINTING THE SICK: Blessing people who are in danger of dying with
special oil.
HOLY ORDERS: Acknowledges people who become ordained priests.
MATRIMONY: Acknowledges people who are being married.
These seven sacraments are believed to be a gift from Christ to the church, and
performing them is seen as a path to salvation. Catholics believe that salvation
comes from both faith in Christ and doing good works, and not, as Protestants
believe, faith alone. Thus, after being purified through baptism, in order to best
achieve salvation, Catholics must ask forgiveness for each successive sin that
they commit.
Throughout history, the Catholic Church has played an enormous role in the
politics of Europe and the rest of the world. It has been involved in conflicts
such as the Crusades, and it also has been a safe repository of knowledge during
chaotic times such as the Middle Ages. Its popes and bishops have been major
players on the world stage in every era.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. The Eastern Orthodox Church also believes in the seven sacraments.
However, they and other sects do not believe the Eucharist is a literal
consumption of Christ's body.
2. Pope Benedict XVI, elected in 2005, is expected to be a hard-line conservative
pope, who will not waver from the church's conservative stances.
3. The concepts ofpurgatory and hell, often conflated, have distinct meanings in
Catholicism. Whereas hell is a permanent state of damnation, purgatory, on the
other hand, is a place where the deceased may become purified on their way to
heaven, ifthey have notyet received forgiveness for their sins.
MONDAY, DAY I
Thomas Paine
Thomas Paine (1737-1809) was a radical pamphlet writer and political
philosopher whose famous 1776 book Common SenseconvincedmanyAmericans
to join the Revolution against British rule. Paine despised the British monarchy
and believed republicanism was the best form of government. Paine himself was
a lifelong rabble-rouser and propagandist who was attracted to revolutionary
causes against despotic governments. Truly a man of the world, Paine also
participated in the French Revolution and wrote another fiery book, Rights of
Man, defending the revolution that toppled Louis XV I.
Paine had a habit of alienating his own supporters and received little thanks for
his efforts during his lifetime. After moving to France, he unexpectedly opposed
the execution of the deposed king. Paine was soon arrested and sentenced to
death by the revolutionary government that he himself supported. Paine escaped
the guillotine by sheer luck, when the executioner failed to notice the chalk mark
on his cell door that meant he was to be beheaded. Paine eventually returned to
the United States, where his unconventional religious beliefs (he called the Bible
a fabulous invention) made him an outcast. Destitute, he died in 1809.
Paine's writing style was uncompromising, inflammatory, and inspiring. In
Common Sense, he referred to George III as a "royal brute" and monarchy as an
"evil." Establishing a republican form of government in America, Paine
believed, would inspire other suffering peoples across the world. "The cause of
America is in a great measure the cause of all mankind," he wrote. Paine's
tireless propaganda efforts won respect even from his critics. John Adams, the
second president of the United States, who called Paine a "mongrel between pig
and puppy," conceded that "without the pen of Paine, the sword of Washington
would have been wielded in vain."
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Ten years after his death, Paine's skeleton was exhumed by an English admirer
who wanted to rebury him in England. The reburial never occurred, though,
and what became ofPaine's bones remains a mystery.
2. Paine wrote the Rights of Man in response to Edmund Burke, a conservative
British lawmaker who was aghast at the French Revolution. Paine argued that
the miserable conditions of French peasants made revolution justified and
scorned Burke's call for modest, incremental reforms instead ofarmed revolt.
3. Paine is generally credited with inventing the name "United States
ofAmerica"for the thirteen colonies.
TUESDAY, DAY 2
Virginia Woolf
British novelist and critic Virginia Woolf (1882-1941) was one of the most
influential writers of the modernist movement. Along with Joyce, Faulkner, and
others, she revolutionized the novel with radically new narrative techniques and
thematic concerns. Woolf's involvement in the intellectual high society of
England, meanwhile, made her a major cultural figure herself.
Woolf came from a privileged London background, and she largely educated
herself by reading in the library of her father, a Cambridge-educated author and
editor. After Woolf's mother's death in 1895, she began to experience nervous
breakdowns and depression, which haunted her for the rest of her life. She wrote
prolifically, however, and in 1912 married Leonard Woolf. In 1917, the couple
started a small publishing house to produce and distribute Virginia's works and
the writings of other authors.
Together, the Woolfs were active in the liberal London intellectual scene. For
decades, they met on Thursday evenings at the home of Woolf's sister, Vanessa,
in the Bloomsbury neighborhood of central London. Guests frequently included
E. M. Forster, Lytton Strachey, John Maynard Keynes, T. S. Eliot, Aldous
Huxley, and others. This Bloomsbury group, as it came to be called, discussed
questions of philosophy, religion, politics, aesthetics, sexuality, and literature.
Like many writers of the time, Woolf and the Bloomsbury group were horrified
by the pointless brutality of World War I. They grew to believe that the
principles of nineteenth-century realist literature were inadequate to describe the
world that confronted them after the war. They resolved to develop an entirely
new frame of reference to interpret this changed world.
Woolf led the charge herself, experimenting with stream-of-consciousness
narration depicting the uninterrupted current of a character's thoughts-in Mrs.
Dalloway (1925). The novel's simple plot, which follows a woman as she makes
preparations for a party, is far less important than the inner workings of the
characters' psyches. Though the narrative darts in and out of the minds of
different people, only rarely do these characters connect on a significant level or
find their thoughts on the same page.
Woolf was also fascinated by how people perceive the flow of time, from
fleeting moments to sweeping decades. The lengthy first section of her novel To
the Lighthouse (1927) focuses in great detail on a single day; the far shorter
second section shows the passage of many years in just a few pages. Woolf
advanced this exploration of both time and stream of consciousness in The
Waves (1931), an experimental work that follows the voices of six friends from
youth to old age.
ADDITIONAL FACT
1. Ultimately, Woolf was unable to bear the burden ofher mental illness. In
March 1941, after leaving a note for her husband, she drowned herself in the
Ouse River near their Sussex home, Monk's House.
WEDNESDAY, DAY 3
Francisco de Goya
Francisco Jose de Goya y Lucientes (1746-1828) was born the son of a
goldsmith in Fuendetodos, Spain. Court painter to Charles IV, Goya became not
only Spain's chief Romantic artist, but a harbinger of modern Expressionism.
Legends abound about Goya's early life as a bullfighter, guitar player, and ladies'
man. In 1775, he moved to Madrid, where he became a designer for the Royal
Tapestry Factory of Santa Barbara. Between 1800 and 1808, he painted two of
his most famous works, the Maja Desnuda and the Maja Vestita, which captured
the same maja, or courtesan, first nude, then clothed.
In 1798, Goya published a series of eighty-three etchings and aquatints entitled
Los Caprichos. The best known of these is number forty-three, The Sleep of
Reason Produces Monsters, in which monsters representing nightmares surround
the head of a man who has fallen asleep at his desk. In that same year the
Spanish king, Charles IV, appointed Goya his official court painter. In 1799,
Goya completed The Family of Charles IV, a group portrait that some critics
believe was done in mockery of the royal family. (The family appears somewhat
grotesque and vulgar despite their fine garments.) Goya's model for the
composition was Diego Velazquez's Las Meninas. Like his predecessor, also
court painter to a Spanish monarch, Goya included a portrait of himself before
an easel in the background of the painting.
Another two of Goya's well known paintings are his Second of May, 1808 and
Third of May, 1808, which were based on Napoleon's invasion of Spain in 1808.
On May 2°', after the emperor had proclaimed his brother king, Spanish crowds
attempted to fight off French soldiers. The next day, a French firing squad shot
thirty Spanish civilians as a retaliatory measure. Goya presented the two works
to Ferdinand VII six years later, after the Spanish king had regained the throne.
While The Second of May, 1808 shows the skirmish between the Spaniards and
the French soldiers, Third of May, 1808 depicts the firing squad about to execute
a defiant yet fearful man, awaiting his death with outstretched hands.
Disillusioned with the political situation in Spain, Goya retired to his country
home, the socalled Quinta del Sordo or "House of the Deaf Man" (Goya went
deaf in 1792.) He covered the walls of his residence with a series of nightmarish
"Black Paintings" that revealed his despair and feverish imagination. Perhaps the
most horrifying of the murals is Saturn Devouring His Children, which portrays
the frenzied primordial giant tearing into the bloody corpse of a child.
After 1824, Goya produced no more paintings. He went into voluntary exile in
France, where he died in Bordeaux in 1828. His remains were returned to
Madrid in 1899.
ADDITIONAL FACT
1. In The Third of May, 1808, the French soldiers stand with their backs to the
viewer, creating a faceless wall, while each of the Spaniards waiting to die
responds with a different emotion. Goya made the victims appear vulnerable
and human, and the members of the firing squad cold and insensible to the pain
they are causing.
THURSDAY, DAY 4
Reproduction
In the plant and animal kingdoms, there are two main ways to reproduce:
asexually and sexually. One is more risky, the other more costly.
Asexual reproduction requires only one parent. There is no time or energy
wasted in finding a mate, courting, or the physical act of sex itself. Budding is a
common form of asexual reproduction found in strawberries, aspen trees, and
coral. In budding, the offspring grows from a part of the parent. Sometimes they
break apart, but other times they remain connected for life. Fields of strawberries
and forests of aspen trees are often thought of as one large organism, connected
through a budding system of vines and roots. In fragmentation, another common
form of asexual reproduction, the parent breaks itself into small pieces that each
grows into separate individuals. In other words, the death of the parent leads to
new life. Flatworms are known for fragmenting.
The offspring of asexual reproduction are always genetically identical to their
parents. This is often a disadvantage, as without genetic variety, the population
has a more difficult time evolving to changes in the environment. Asexual
organisms tend to thrive in stable environments.
Sexual reproduction allows for more flexibility. In sexual reproduction, two
separate parents contribute their genes to their offspring. Typically, the male and
the female contribute half of their genetic endowment in a vessel called a
gamete. The male gamete is usually a sperm, and the female gamete is usually an
egg. When the sperm and the egg combine, they create a new organism that is
genetically different from either parent. Sexual reproduction can therefore
introduce a greater variety of traits into a population, at a faster rate than asexual
reproduction. This is a great advantage in changing environments. As a rule,
higher organisms all reproduce sexually. But they also have to expend a great
deal of energy creating gametes and finding mates.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Starfish reproduce asexually through regeneration. Ifa starfish arm breaks off,
it can grow into an entirely new organism.
2. Sometimes the cost of sex becomes too great, and the organism reverts to
asexual reproduction. This may have happened to dandelions.
3. Some aphids and lizards reproduce through parthenogenesis, sexual
reproduction without fertilization by a male.
FRIDAY, DAY 5
Ludwig van Beethoven
History has made Ludwig van Beethoven (1770-1827) into many things: the
bridge between the Classical and Romantic periods; a tortured, suffering genius;
and sometimes even the greatest composer of all time. But unlike Bach and
Mozart, upon whom that same accolade has been heaped, Beethoven made bold
steps to escape the conventions under which his talents developed. His truest
legacy in the end is that he was Western music's first great musical personality.
He forced himself into every piece he wrote and into the heart and mind of every
listener who heard his music for the first time.
In his adult life, Beethoven was plagued by a painful intestinal condition, a
swollen pancreas, and cirrhosis of the liver. Around 1800, he began to face a
composer's worst nightmare: He was losing his hearing. Instead of despairing,
Beethoven worked doubly hard and refused to put the whims of his patrons
before his own burning creative desire. "What is in my heart must come out," he
wrote in a letter, "and I so write it down."
Beethoven's career went through three stages. In the first, much of his work,
including his first two very classically Viennese symphonies, sounds similar to
that of Haydn. That first stage ended with his Symphony No. 3 "Eroica" (1804),
a landmark piece originally intended to be dedicated to Napoleon Bonaparte. It
stretched the boundaries of the classical symphony with its bombastic and heavy
finale. Vienna had never heard anything like it, and in the period that followed,
his so-called "Heroic Period," Beethoven composed some of his masterworks,
including the opera Fidelio, several amazing piano concertos, and a violin
concerto.
In the final stage of his life, starting around 1810, Beethoven became more and
more isolated from the outside world. He was lonely, constantly in love, and
drifting into despair over his increasingly painful physical condition and growing
deafness. He died in Vienna, among friends, in 1827.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Beethoven's father was an abusive, alcoholic court singer in the German town
ofBonn. When Ludwig was a boy, his father tried to make his son into a
Mozart-style prodigy by locking him in his room for hours to practice
harpsichord.
2. In 1802 Beethoven wrote a famous letter to his brother known as the
HeiligenstadtManifesto,"named for the town where he wrote it, explaining in
florid, sometimes abstruse language that he lived in a state of constant despair,
and that if it weren't for his love of music and his passion for life, he would
surely kill himself.
SATURDAY, DAY 6
Liberalism
Liberalism is a tradition in political philosophy that emphasizes individualism,
equality, and freedom. It is a normative theory-it describes how things ought to
be, rather than how they in fact are-about what kind of government or political
system is justified.
A political system is justifiable only on liberal grounds to the extent that it
secures some good for individuals. Liberals believe that individuals have desires
and wants that precede political systems, and the purpose of political systems is
to attain these goods for individuals.
Another requirement of the liberal theory is that all citizens be treated equally in
the eyes of the government. There is significant disagreement within liberalism
whether political equality of this kind is compatible with vast differences in
wealth. Thinkers like John Locke and Robert Nozick believed people have a
natural right to property-in other words, the right to property existed before any
government. Therefore, they concluded that only very limited infringements on
the pre-political rights of ownership are justified. Other thinkers, like the theorist
John Rawls, argued that true equality cannot exist when there are great
disparities in wealth.
The third important requirement in liberal political theory is that the government
should preserve the freedom of its citizens. Liberals view the value of
government as instrumental to secure goods for individual people. With this idea
comes the idea that people have freedoms independent of the political system
and that the system cannot unreasonably infringe upon these freedoms. However,
there is significant disagreement among liberals about what would constitute an
unreasonable infringement of freedom.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Political philosophers outside the liberal tradition believe that the group or
nation has rights of its own that must be taken into account. These theorists
would say that, in the right circumstances, the good of individuals must be
sacrificed for thegood of the group.
2. Liberal political philosophy is not the same as political Liberalism in the
United States and elsewhere. All mainstream political thinking in the United
States is liberal, in the philosophical sense.
SUNDAY, DAY 7
Eastern Orthodox
The Eastern Orthodox Church separated from the Roman Catholic Church
during the Great Schism of 1054.
The Christian Church had long recognized the special status of the bishops in
Alexandria, Antioch, Constantinople, Jerusalem, and of course, Rome. The
Bishop of Rome, the heir to St. Peter, was elevated above all the rest. Still, over
time, those in the Eastern regions of Christendom began to drift apart over
differences in language, politics, and liturgical custom.
In the mid-eleventh century, the relationship had disintegrated to a breaking
point. While both sides were in the midst of not particularly promising
negotiations, Pope Leo IX died, creating a power struggle. The emissaries of the
Western Church excommunicated the leader of the Eastern Church, the Patriarch
Cerularius, initiating the separation that would prove to be irreparable.
As the Eastern Church established itself, it took the name Orthodox to signifyits
strict adherence to the original traditions of Christianity. The church had a
stronger oral tradition than did the Catholics, allowing the Eastern Church to rely
less heavily on the written text of the Bible.
The Eastern Orthodox believe that man was initially good, but fell prey to
temptation and turned evil. Thus, every human who died before Jesus Christ was
born went to hell. Christ's appearance on earth, however, by embodying both
man and God, paved the way for humans' ascension to heaven. This retroactively
brought all those who had been damned in the past to heaven as well. The
Eastern Orthodox believe that God alone will choose who is saved and who is
not. Therefore, the best thing to do to win God's favor is to follow the Eastern
Orthodox traditions, which can be traced back to Christ.
Eastern Orthodox priests, unlike Catholics, are allowed to marry, as long as they
do so before ordination. In fact, it is thought that priests who lead congregations
should be married because they will have to regularly counsel married couples.
Today, the Eastern Orthodox Church is somewhat decentralized; each national
church (the largest being Greek) has a Patriarch, and each of these Patriarchs has
equal power. Thus, while both the Roman Catholics and the Eastern Orthodox
can trace their lineage directly back to Christ, for the second millennium of
Christianity, the Eastern Church has differed significantly from its Western
cousin.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. The term Greek Orthodox is sometimes used to refer to the entire Eastern
Orthodoxy and not just the Greek National Church.
2. In the Eastern Orthodox tradition, fasting is often required to emulate the
perfection ofAdam and Eve who, before they succumbed to temptation,
subsisted on merely the fruits available in the Garden ofEden. Fasting is looked
upon as a privilege.
MONDAY, DAY I
The French Revolution
Before it was toppled in 1798, the French monarchy had grown corrupt and
greedy, fueling the resentment of the lower and middle classes. While French
peasants starved, the nobles lived a life of luxury. When Queen Marie Antoinette
was informed that her subjects had no bread to eat, she is famously believed to
have suggested, "Let them eat cake." At that time, political prisoners were sent
to the Bastille, a feared prison in the heart of Paris.
The Revolution began July 14, 1789, with the storming of the Bastille to free the
prisoners. The revolutionaries wanted to radically change French society, and
they were willing to resort to great violence. Fired by the ideals of
Enlightenment-liberty, equality, fraternity-the revolutionists sought to overthrow
the hereditary monarchy and also to break the power of the church. They even
sough to remake the calendar into a more rational system.
But the revolution was mired in violence and even anarchy. In just a few years,
thousands of men and women were put to death on the guillotine, which the
enlightened leaders of the revolution believed was a less painful, more modern
way of beheading criminals. Painted blood red, the machine stood four meters
tall and occupied a central square in the heart of Paris. A harpsichord-maker in
the French capital hastily constructed the gruesome device for 960 francs.
Of course, most of the people who died on the guillotine were not criminals but
merely political opponents of the new regime. Thousands died in the Reign of
Terror that followed the overthrow of King Louis XVI, including eventually the
king himself and Queen Marie Antoinette in 1793.
The defeat of continental Europe's most powerful and admired monarchy by a
radical rabble was a profound shock to the continent. The age of absolute
monarchy was over.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Prior to the revolution, only noblemen had the privilege of execution by
beheading. Mere commoners were hanged.
2. The British thinker Edmund Burke believed that however corrupt the
monarchy, the French Revolution was too bloody to be justified. His treatise,
Reflections on the Revolution in France, is one ofthe founding documents of
modern conservatism.
3. The French national anthem, "La Marseillaise," was written by a revolutionary
officer from the city of Marseille in 1792. The bloodthirsty lyrics call for
Frenchmen to "drench our fields / With their tainted blood," but that didn't stop
the Beatles from using a recording of the anthem in the first few bars of their
1967 song All You Need is Love."
TUESDAY, DAY 2
Moby-Dick
Herman Melville's Moby-Dick (1851) is the undisputed giant of American
literature. The novel still looms large in Western culture, and few people are
unfamiliar with its story-though probably just as few have actually read the book
start to finish. Ironically, despite Moby-Dick's major role in putting American
literature on the map, the novel was poorly received, viewed as a step below
Melville's other works.
The novel's narrator, Ishmael, decides to seek relief from a midlife crisis by
joining the crew of a whaling ship. He travels to the whaling hub of New
Bedford, Massachusetts, and finds work on a ship called the Pequod. Ishmael
learns that the vessel's enigmatic and reclusive captain, Ahab, is missing a leg,
which he lost to the jaws of an infamously ferocious white sperm whale called
Moby-Dick. Only when the Pequod is well out to sea does Ahab emerge on deck
and announce that the sole goal of the expedition is to hunt down and destroy
Moby Dick, wherever he is in the vastness of the ocean.
Ahab's obsessive search takes the Pequod thousands of miles, around the
southern tip of Africa and toward Southeast Asia. Despite numerous bad omens,
Ahab focuses unwaveringly and maniacally on his quest for vengeance, all the
while making near-biblical pronouncements:
"Towards thee I roll, thou all-destroying but unconquering whale; to
the last Igrapple with thee; from hell's heart I stab at thee; for hate's
sake I spit my last breath at thee."
Ultimately, the Pequod finds Moby-Dick in the waters of the Pacific. In the
monumental battle that ensues, the whale destroys the ship, Ahab is killed, and
the entire crew-save Ishmael-is sucked down into the depths.
Moby-Dick contains philosophical musings on countless topics, from the Bible
to fate to the solitude of the ocean. The white whale itself is one of the great
enigmatic symbols of literature, and theories about what it signifies vary greatly.
Ahab views it as an embodiment of all the evil in the world and believes it his
existential duty to confront and defeat this evil.
Ishmael tries to understand the whale by considering it piece by piece; individual
chapters of Moby-Dick discuss the whale's head, spout, tail, and so on. But
despite these efforts, Ishmael finds that the creature's gargantuan, unfathomable
quality can be captured neither by the human mind nor by the written word.
Some critics have therefore taken the whale as a representation of God, a
reminder of the inevitable doom that befalls any man prideful enough to try to
control the uncontrollable or comprehend the incomprehensible.
ADDITIONAL FACT
LA n albino sperm whale dubbed Mocha Dick was seen for decades off the
Chilean coast before it was finally captured in the 1830s. Melville clearly drew
from the story, but it is unclear why he altered the whale's name.
WEDNESDAY, DAY 3
Joseph Mallard William Turner
The greatest English painter of the romantic movement, Joseph Mallard William
Turner (1775-1851), is best known for his dramatic landscapes and depictions of
nature's power.
Turner was born in Chelsea, now part of London. His father, a barber, was quick
to recognize his son's artistic inclinations. In 1789, at the age of fourteen, Turner
entered the prestigious Royal Academy of Arts. His first work was exhibited
there the following year. Throughout the 1790s, he painted primarily in
watercolor. In 1796, he exhibited his first oil painting, Fishermen at Sea.
Turner opened his own gallery on Harley Street in 1804 but continued to show in
the Academy. For nearly thirty years-from 1808 to 1837-he also taught a course
on perspective.
Throughout his life, Turner traveled a great deal, both in Britain and abroad.
After visiting Wales, Yorkshire, and the Lake District, he went to Switzerland,
then to France in 1802-3, where he studied paintings at the Louvre. During his
travels, Turner learned to paint in the styles of various old masters, such as
Titian, Canaletto, and Claude Lorrain. A subsequent trip to Italy in 1819 had a
profound effect on his use of light and color. By 1822, Turner had established his
reputation at home. The English King, George IV, commissioned him to paint
The Battle of Trafalgar.
Inspired by descriptions of natural phenomena in English romantic poetry,
Turner portrayed nature with reverence and trepidation. In many cases, he
included lines of poetry, often from his own writings, in his paintings. He also
prepared illustrations for the works of Lord Byron, Sir Walter Scott, and Samuel
Rogers.
Although he taught at the Royal Academy, Turner was not universally admired
during his lifetime. Criticized for expanding the boundaries of what was
acceptable in art, he found a staunch ally in the art critic John Ruskin, who came
to his defense in his famous book on landscape painting, Modern Painters, first
published in 1843.
Today Turner is viewed as an important forerunner of modern movements such
as impressionism and abstract expressionism. A special wing of the Tate
museum in London is devoted to his works. In 1984, the Turner Prize was
established to recognize the achievements of outstanding modern artists.
ADDITIONAL FACT
1. In 1840, Turner painted what many consider his best work, The Slave Ship (or
Slavers Throwing Overboard the Dead and Dying. Typhoon Coming.) The
painting was based on an actual event reported in Thomas Clarkson's The
History of the Abolition of the Slave Trade. A ship captain had cast sick and
dying slaves into the ocean when he realized that he would be reimbursed only
for slaves lost at sea, not those who died aboard his ship.
THURSDAY, DAY 4
Stem Cells
Stems cells may be the key to unlocking the mystery behind some of the world's
most perplexing diseases-Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, diabetes, and cancer. All of
these diseases involve damaged tissues that need to be repaired or replaced.
Stem cells have the unique ability to differentiate themselves into other
specialized cells. They can also divide and renew themselves over long periods
of time. For example, if stem cells could be introduced into a section of the brain
that had been ravaged by Parkinson's disease, they might be able to replace the
neurons damaged by the disorder.
There are two basic types of stems cells: embryonic stem cells and adult stem
cells. Embryonic stem cells are pluripotent; they can grow into any type of cell
in the body. They usually come from fertilized eggs that have been discarded
after a fertility treatment. When an egg becomes fertilized, it begins to divide.
After about five days, it is a collection of about 150 cells called a blastocyst. The
inner cells of the blastocyst are pluripotent stem cells.
Little is known about the uses of human embryonic stein cells. Scientists only
learned how to cultivate them in a laboratory in 1998, and other restrictions on
research have been legislated. Still scientists have been using adult stem cells for
therapeutic purposes for more than thirty years.
Adult stem cells are found in many places in the body-the skin, brain, and bone
marrow-but they are not as versatile as embryonic stem cells. Adult stein cells
are multipotent, meaning that they can only form a closely related family of
cells. Thus, bone marrow stem cells can form only bone cells, cartilage cells, and
fat cells. However, unlike embryonic stem cells that have to come from an
outside source, adult stein cells often come from within the infirmed individual's
body, making it less likely they will be rejected by the individual's immune
system.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Hair follicles also contain stem cells, and some researchers believe that those
stem cells may lead to a cure for baldness as early as 2007
2. Adult stem cells from bone marrow have been used to treat leukemia and
lymphoma since the 1970s.
3. Using stem cells, scientists have been able to regenerate missing teeth in mice.
FRIDAY, DAY 5
Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 "Choral"
In 1792, Beethoven began studying with Haydn, and later with Antonio Salieri.
Beethoven was a brash, arrogant student, famous in the region for his passionate
keyboard improvisations. Many critics say that Beethoven finally became a
mature composer when he learned to combine his zeal and love for music with
the logic of classical forms.
Beethoven's strict adherence to classical convention ended in 1810, when he
entered a stage of deep despair and alienation brought on by the hardships of his
physical health, his loss of hearing, and his loneliness. He performed on piano
for the last time in 1814, and after 1819, all conversation with the great
composer was conducted through written notes.
It was in this frame of mind, toward the very end of his life, that Beethoven
wrote his Symphony No. 9 (1824). An admirable expression of his creative
flame, it was written while the composer was completely deaf a final expression
of his love for music and his passionate artistry.
Lasting more than an hour, the four-movement symphony starts with a dramatic
opening movement, loosely adhering to the classical formula. That leads into a
light, but smoldering scherzo movement (a dance form.) The slow adagio section
followsa long, delicate, barely sane moment of quiet before the storm of the
finale.
The final movement of the Choral Symphony is one of the greatest finales of all
time and is almost universally recognizable. It is the first time a symphony made
use of a full chorus alongside a full orchestra. When that chorus takes up the
refrain of the Ode to Joy, an ecstatic hymn to life, the music builds slowly to the
movement's booming, euphoric climax.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. The text for the Ode to joy, which contains the lines, `joy, bright spark of
divinity, Daughter ofElysium / Fire-inspired we tread Thy sanctuary..
."comesfrom a 1785 poem by German poet Friedrich Schiller.
2. Legend has it that when Beethoven died, shortly after completing his ninth
symphony, there was a rainstorm in Vienna. He was lying unconscious on his
bed, and at the moment ofa lightning strike, he suddenly sat up, shook his fist
at the heavens, and fell back dead.
SATURDAY, DAY 6
Social Contract
The social contract is a concept in political philosophy used to understand the
origin and legitimacy of political systems.
The idea behind the social contract is that at some hypothetical point in the past,
human beings had no government and no laws. In order to safeguard their
physical safety and provide the conditions for prosperity, these original humans
made an agreement. In exchange for the stability and security of laws, everyone
ceded some of his or her original freedoms to a government.
The first modern social contract theorist was Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679). In
his book Leviathan, Hobbes describes life before government- as he called it, the
"state of nature"-as "solitary, nasty, poor, brutish and short." Therefore, the only
rational option for people was to form a social contract in which they gave up
authority to a ruler. According to Hobbes, the state of nature was so bad that no
matter how tyrannical or arbitrary the ruler is, his reign is preferable. Therefore,
we have no right to revolt. Hobbes argued further that the sovereign must be
granted absolute, unconditional power, with no checks or balances.
English philosopher John Locke (1634-1704) thought that the social contract had
to do more than just protect people's physical safety. It also had to respect
individuals' rights to life, liberty, and property. If the political authority
constituted by the social contract violated these rights, Locke believed citizens
had the right to nullify contract and rebel. Another important theorist of the
social contract was Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-1718).
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) believed the highest accomplishments of human
nature are impossible without living in a civil condition. Therefore, Kant held
that we are obligated to leave the state of nature and form a social contract.
2. Rousseau's political ideas were influential in the French Revolution.
SUNDAY, DAY 7
Protestant Reformation
In the early sixteenth century, after much of Europe had become displeased with
the Roman Catholic Church, Martin Luther instigated the Protestant
Reformation.
Martin Luther, a professor and preacher in Germany, studied religious texts at
great length. His first disagreement with the Catholic Church concerned the
church's practice of indulgences for sins. Indulgence was the Catholic tradition
of forgiving sin. At the time, such absolution was for sale. In exchange for
money, the donor's sentence in purgatory was reduced. Luther objected to the
notion of buying salvation, arguing it was horribly detrimental to the faith.
In 1517, Luther nailed Ninety-Five Theses to the church door at Wittenburg,
challenging the Catholic Church and the legitimacy of the pope, as well as the
practice of indulgences. Luther believed that the church had lost sight of its
original doctrines, namely those coming directly from the text of the Bible, and
had created an unnecessary wedge between the clergy and churchgoers.
By posting the Ninety-Five Theses, Luther sparked a great debate that quickly
spread to the rest of Germany, Switzerland, Austria, England, and Scotland. As
discussion traveled, the writings of John Calvin, among others, further fueled the
dissent among the European populace.
As the many reformers' beliefs began to coincide over time, the Protestant
religion took shape. At the heart of this reformist faith was the belief that the
only religious authority was the Bible itself, and not the pope. This
revolutionized the structure of the church and emphasized that individuals could
relate more directly to God, without priests as intermediaries.
The Protestants eventually fractured into many sects, such as the Lutherans,
Calvinists, and Anabaptists; and the Catholics launched a Counter-Reformation,
becoming more conservative.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. At age twenty-two, Martin Luther was returning to school during a lightning
storm. After a lightning bolt struck near him, he exclaimed `Help, Saint Anne!
I'll become a monk!"He survived and kept his promise, leaving law school for a
monastery.
2. The Protestant Reformation was further strengthened by KingHenry VII
ofEngland's split with the Roman Catholic Church in 1529. The king appointed
himself head of England's Church, enabling Not to divorce his wife, Queen
Catherine, which the pope would not allow.
3. Although no evidence of the original Ninety-Five Theses exists, many experts
believe the legendary church- doorposting is not very far fetched: At the time,
university's church doors were used to post notices much as bulletin boards are
used today.
MONDAY, DAY I
Thomas Jefferson
"Force cannot change right."
-Thomas Jefferson
Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826) was the third president of the United States and
one of the most influential men in Revolutionary America. In his writings,
including the Declaration of Independence in 1776, Jefferson articulated the
ideals of the young republic with rare eloquence. Later, as president, Jefferson
put aside his own doubts and approved the purchase of the Louisiana territory
from France for three cents an acre, doubling the size of the United States.
Jefferson was born in 1743 in Shadwell, Virginia. Before the Revolution, he
practiced law. Jefferson's interests were not confined to politics. He was also an
architect and inventor. His education at the College of William and Mary, where
he read philosophical works by John Locke, strongly influenced his political
views.
In 1776, Jefferson attended the Continental Congress in Philadelphia that
brought together the leading citizens of the thirteen restive colonies. High taxes
and repression had convinced the delegates to support independence from the
British crown. The leaders of the convention asked the thirtythree-year-old
Jefferson to join John Adams and Benjamin Franklin in writing a formal
statement to send to London. The result was the Declaration of Independence, a
powerful denunciation of British rule, which borrowed from Locke and other
philosophical influences.
What sort of government would replace British rule? Jefferson, a southern
farmer and slaveholder, envisioned a republic of yeoman farmers with a weak
central government and a strong separation of church from state. Jefferson's
vision remained a potent influence on generations of politicians, especially in the
south, who opposed a strong federal government. Despite Jefferson's declared
opposition to a strong federal government, as president he approved the purchase
of Louisiana from France, a decision that many constitutional scholars believe
exceeded his executive powers.
After Jefferson's presidency, he retired to his hilltop mansion at Monticello,
where he died on July 4, 1826, fifty years to the day after his Declaration of
Independence sounded the clarion call against British rule.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. A bust of Jefferson-along with Theodore Roosevelt, George Washington, and
Abraham Lincoln-is carved onto the side ofMount Rushmore in South Dakota.
2. Jefferson and Adams were political opponents who twice ran against each
other for the presidency but became friends after retiring from politics. Adams
died on the same day as Jefferson.
3. Although Jefferson frequently argued that slavery was a moral evil, like many
other Founding Fathers he owned slaves. According to a recent DNA study by
one historian, Jefferson fathered a number of children with one ofthem, Sally
Hemings.
TUESDAY, DAY 2
"The Road Not Taken"
There exists probably no American poem so frequently quoted yet so widely
misinterpreted as Robert Frost's "The Road Not Taken" (1916). Almost without
fail, readers miss the meaning of the poem by miles, seeing it as a rosy
testament to the speaker's faith in free will and an inspiring call to defy
convention and take the road "less traveled by." But close reading reveals that
the poem actually is laden with the ironic resignation for which Frost was
renowned.
The point most overlooked in the poem is the utter arbitrariness of the speaker's
decision about which road to take. In describing his choice between the two
paths, he emphasizes repeatedly that they are essentially identical. One path
looks "as just as fair" as the other, and despite the speaker's desire to
differentiate them, he acknowledges that "the passing there / Had worn them
really about the same." On a whim, he chooses one over the other.
In the last stanza, Frost injects his trademark wry humor. The speaker admits
that "ages and ages hence," as a reminiscing old man, he will probably retell
this story "with a sigh" and claim that he courageously chose the unorthodox
route, the one "less traveled by." But such a claim would be false. The speaker
just finished telling us that his choice was totally arbitrary, as there was no "less
traveled" path to begin with: they both "equally lay / In leaves no step had
trodden black." Frost recognizes the human tendency to self-aggrandize, to
sugarcoat the uncertainty of life, to take comfort in viewing life as a series of
conscious, knowable choices between good and bad alternatives. But his
ultimate point is that in reality, we have no way ofknowing which path in life is
best, and our decisions are just as often random, uneducated guesses.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Frost was well aware that most readers misinterpreted "The Road Not Taken.
"During one famous lecture, he warned the audience, "You have to be careful
of that one. It's a tricky poem, very tricky."
2. Frost's career started remarkably late for a poet. His firstpublisbed
collection, A Boy's Will (1913), did not appear until he was almost forty.
3. President john F. Kennedy greatly admired the works ofFrost, who read his
poem "The Gift Outright"at his inauguration ceremony in 1961.
WEDNESDAY, DAY 3
Impressionism
Impressionism began in France in the 1870s. The aim of impressionist painters
was to replicate the visual impression made by an object on the human eye.
More than anything else, they were interested in the changing nature of light and
the way it affected vision.
Unlike previous artists who chose subjects from history or mythology,
impressionists painted the everyday world around them. They were, in fact, the
first artists to consistently work outside. Since they had to paint quickly to
capture the effect of light on an object, they did not sketch or plan their paintings
in advance, but worked immediately from nature. Realizing that the eye rarely
sees anything that is perfectly still, they did not give hard outlines to their
subjects, but instead painted them with loose, large brushstrokes, creating the
illusion of movement. Rather than mixing colors on their palettes, they dabbed
pure colors side by side, directly on the canvas. From close up, the colors appear
disparate; from a distance, however, they blend together.
The invention of photography was a major influence on the development of
impressionism. Like photographers, the impressionists were interested in optics,
light, and color; and they were concerned with capturing the world exactly as it
appeared to the eye.
Although earlier artists such as Turner had already shown great interest in the
qualities of light, the origins of impressionism are usually traced to the realist
movement and one of its chief representatives in France, Edouard Manet. Like
his impressionist friends (with whom he never, in fact, exhibited), Manet
gravitated toward everyday subjects and loose brushwork. Like them, too, he
was a rebel, who dared to scorn the conventions of the official, statesponsored
Academic des beaux-arts.
In 1874, when the impressionists were rejected from the exhibition held annually
at the Salon des Artistes, they organized their own show. The group included
luminaries such as Claude Monet, Auguste Renoir, Edgar Degas, and Altered
Sisley. A painting by Monet entitled Impression: Sunrise, provided Louis Leroya
hostile critic-with the initially pejorative term impressionists for the artists.
All in all, the group staged eight shows, the final one in 1886. By that time,
many of its members were working in new styles that would eventually be
termed postimpressionist. Nevertheless, most major art movements of the
modern era have been inspired by the impressionists' independence and courage
to break with established tradition.
ADDITIONAL FACT
1. Since impressionists worked quickly, often completing a painting in one day,
they were much more prolific than earlier artists, who often spent weeks
preparing one composition. Today hundreds of impressionist paintings can be
seen throughout the world both in museums and in private collections.
Particularly well known for their holdings are the Musee d'Orsay in Paris, the
Art Institute of Chicago, and the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia.
THURSDAY, DAY 4
Electromagnetic Spectrum
The electromagnetic spectrum describes the full range of electromagnetic
radiation in the universe. Electromagnetic radiation is simply another term for
light. All light is made of photons, tiny massless packets of energy that move in
waves through the vacuum of space. Photons always travel at the same speed,
299,792,458 meters per second. But some of their wavelengths are longer than
others. If a photon has a longer wavelength and wiggles less frequently, it has
lower energy. If a photon has a short wavelength and wiggles more frequently, it
has high energy. In this way, a photon is like a football player running down a
field to catch a ball. No matter what, he has to be in the end zone in time to catch
the ball. If he can run in a fairly straight line, he can get there with relatively
little energy. But if he has to zigzag a lot, he expends more energy.
Radio waves are long wavelength, low frequency, and low energy forms of light.
Their wavelength varies from about 1 to 100 meters. Because they are so low
energy, they rarely interact with matter in any palpable way.
Visible light has a shorter wavelength and higher frequency than radio waves.
Visible light is a small slice of the electromagnetic spectrum, but it is in this
range that the sun and stars emit most of their radiation. It is probably no
coincidence that our eyes are like two antennae finely tuned to this range of
light. The colors of the rainbow-red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and
violet-are in this tiny spectrum of light. Ultraviolet light comes directly after
violet on the electromagnetic spectrum. Higher energy and higher frequency than
visible light, ultraviolet light can damage eyes and skin with prolonged
exposure.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Gamma rays are the most energetic form oflight. They are released from the
nucleus ofan atom as part ofa radioactive process. In theory, they can have an
infinitely short wavelength.
2. In addition to heating food, microwave radiation, which falls between radio
waves and visible light on the electromagnetic spectrum, is used for wireless
Internet networks.
3. Although sound also travels in waves, it differs from light in that it cannot
travel through a vacuum. That is why there is no sound in space.
4. Most substances on the surface ofthe earth absorb ultraviolet light, but snow
reflects it. This is what causes snow-blindness.
FRIDAY, DAY 5
Romantic Period
The fiery passion of the 19th century romantic-era music, like the literature, art,
and thought of the time, was a reaction to the preceding classical period,
dominated by cool logic and reason. Where the music of Mozart and Haydn was
meant to be pleasant, inspiring, balanced, and lasting, romantics like Hector
Berlioz, Johannes Brahms, and Gustav Mahler put a higher premium on personal
emotional expression. The romantics also had a devoted respect for history,
mythology, magic, mysticism, and heroism. They created cults of genius around
their great composers Beethoven, Schubert, and Wagner.
Melody was extremely important to romantic music-so much so that formal
structures were often sacrificed in favor of letting those melodies develop
naturally. The symphony was the greatest of genres, and many composers
produced very little work of note besides their symphonic works. These
symphonies became much longer, larger in instrumentation, gaudy, bombastic,
and decadent in feel.
Wagner's operas were obsessed with Norse and medieval mythology, full of
music that demanded impressive range, stamina, and power from its singers.
Composers began demanding almost unreasonable virtuosity from their
instrumentalists, to the point that only a few soloists in the world-sometimes
only the composer himselfwere able to play the pieces they wrote.
The main criticism leveled at romantic music is that its composers lacked taste,
taking their music too far. However, a huge number of lasting works were
produced in the nineteenth century, and it also saw the blooming of the great
Italian and German opera styles.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. The number ofpieces written by each composer went down in the Romantic
period, as compared to the Classical, but the length of the pieces went up.
Wagner'a Ring Cycle (a four part opera series) lasts more than fifteen hours.
2. The size of ensembles also grew. Gustav Mahler's eighth symphony, the
Symphony of a Thousand, was scored for extended orchestra, double choir,
boys choir, three solo sopranos, two altos, and one tenor, baritone, and bass.
3. Romantic-era composers were less likely to come from the professional
backgrounds and formal training that molded the Classical geniuses. Hector
Berlioz, for example, was hardly a competent player on any instrument, but he
still wrote some highly respected pieces.
SATURDAY, DAY 6
George Berkeley
George Berkeley (1685-1753) was born in Kilkenny, Ireland, in 1685. He
became a priest in the Church of England and spent three years in Newport,
Rhode Island, trying to organize a college for Native Americans in the
Bermudas. When this venture failed, he returned to England, where he was
appointed Bishop of Cloyne, Ireland.
Berkeley's philosophical position was marked by strong commitments to
idealism and theism. For Berkeley, idealism was the view that there are no
material bodies, only spirits, minds, or souls, and the ideas or thoughts in those
spirits. Thus, when we perceive something, we perceive not an independent
object, but only our own ideas. Nothing can exist without either being a spirit, or
being perceived by a spirit. Berkeley's principal argument for idealism was the
following: Try to imagine a material body, for example, a tree, that is not
perceived or thought about by anyone. You cannot, because in the very act of
imagining it you are thinking about it, and therefore, it is thought about by
someone.
God played an important role in Berkeley's idealism. Idealists face a dilemma: If
our experiences are all a product of our perception, and not just our reaction to
independent objects in the world, why are they all so consistent? Berkeley
argued that God causes us to have experiences that are highly harmonious. God
explains why our perceptions and experiences are so regular and law-governed.
Although Berkeley was an avid defender of God's existence, he did not appeal to
authority, to scripture, or to simple faith. He sought to demonstrate that belief in
God was justified on purely philosophical grounds.
ADDITIONAL FACT
1. Berkeley advocated the curative powers of tar-water, a combination of water
and pine tar. He composed a poem in its honor, which includes the lines:
SUNDAY, DAY 7
Constantine I
Constantine I, later called Constantine the Great by Christian historians, is
credited with providing the spark that enabled Christianity to spread freely
throughout Europe.
Christianity was an unsanctioned religion when Constantine was proclaimed
emperor in 306 AD. As was Roman custom, Constantine believed that appeasing
the gods was the only way to avoid suffering. He feared that the Christian refusal
to make and worship idols tempted the wrath of Roman deities. Consequently,
Christians were kept out of government and suppressed by the Roman armies.
However, in 312, Constantine had a change of heart after unifying the Latin-
speaking Western Roman Empire by winning the Battle of Milvian Bridge. As
Constantine prepared to go into the battle, he reportedly saw the Greek initials of
Jesus Christ in the sky, followed by the inscription "Conquer by This." After
emerging victorious, Contantine immediately began to recognize Christianity.
First, Constantine adopted a symbol combining Jesus's Greek initials as his
personal emblem. More important, he joined with Licinius, Emperor of the
Greek-speaking Eastern Roman Empire, and decreed the Edict of Milan.
The Edict of Milan recognized the right of Christians to practice their religion,
returned confiscated Christian property, and allowed Christians to begin
preaching in public, increasing the religion's spread. It also designated Sunday as
a day of worship. The Edict of Milan opened avenues for increasing social and
political participation by Christians.
During this period, the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem and the Church of
the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem were built. It is believed that on his deathbed,
Emperor Constantine himself converted to the faith.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. The Edict of Milan was not officially an edict, nor did it originate from Milan.
The source of the name is unknown.
2. Christianity was not made the official, and only legal, religion of the Roman
Empire until the late fourth century under Emperor Theodosius I.
3. Constantine sponsored and encouraged the Council of Nicaea from which the
Nicene Creed was issued in 325: "We believe in one God the Father, the
Almighty, maker ofheaven and earth, ofall that is seen and unseen. We believe
in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the Son of God."
MONDAY, DAY I
Napoleon Bonaparte
After the revolution in 1789, France endured a decade of war and instability
before Napoleon Bonaparte (1769-1821) took power in 1799. Only thirty years
old, Napoleon established a firm grip over the unruly and chaotic country,
eventually crowning himself emperor in 1804. He was, from the beginning, an
unlikely figure to lead France. Born on the Mediterranean island of Corsica,
Napoleon could not even speak French until he was nine. But the young army
officer sided with the revolutionaries and won the confidence of those who took
power after the king's beheading. A series of military victories in Italy and
Austria in the 1790s made Napoleon popular among the French public, and his
eventual seizure of power was virtually unopposed in France.
Under Napoleon, the French pursued an aggressive foreign policy, exporting
their revolution to the rest of the continent. One by one, Napoleon's armies
toppled the ancient monarchies of Europe. The French believed the great ideals
of their Republic-liberty, equality, and fraternity-were universal and should, if
necessary, be imposed by force. Indeed, many European commoners greeted
Napoleon's troops as liberators from the tyranny of their kings and queens. The
composer Ludwig van Beethoven, an early admirer of Napoleon, dedicated his
Third Symphony to the young emperor as his troops arrived in the composer's
native Germany.
Napoleon remade the legal code in France and proceeded to impose it on
conquered territories in Europe. The Napoleonic Code, which set forth laws
governing property and other civil matters, remains the basis for the legal system
in much of Western Europe to this day.
The French empire envisioned by Napoleon began to collapse after his failed
invasion of Russia in 1812. In 1813, Napoleon was defeated and forced to resign
by an international coalition that included Britain, Russia, Spain, Austria, and
many other states. Napoleon made a brief comeback but was defeated for good
at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. By that time, however, most of the idealism
surrounding Napoleon had faded. Napoleon's France had looted much of Europe.
In fact, many of the treasures in the Louvre Museum in Paris, including art from
the Vatican and Germany, were pillaged by Napoleon's forces. Across the
continent, he left a trail of disillusioned followers.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. After Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo, he was exiled to Saint Helena, a tiny
island in the South Atlantic controlled by the British.
2. Contrary to myth, Napoleon was not exceptionally short. He stood five feet,
six inches, slightly taller than the average Frenchman ofhis day. It was the
English who alleged he was only five feet, two inches.
TUESDAY, DAY 2
The Scarlet Letter
The Scarlet Letter (1850) is the best known work of the nineteenth-century
American novelist and short story writer Nathaniel Hawthorne. Like much of
Hawthorne's writing, it explores social and moral questions through the context
of colonial New England. The novel's extensive use of symbolism makes it an
excellent example of allegorical literature.
The heroine of The Scarlet Letter is Hester Prynne, a young woman living in the
Puritan town of Boston in the 1600s. Although in England she was married to a
man many years her senior, he never followed her to the New World as
promised, and she assumes his ship was lost during the voyage. In Boston,
Hester becomes pregnant as the result of an adulterous relationship and gives
birth to a daughter named Pearl.
Hester refuses to name the child's father, despite intense pressure from the strict
Puritan town leaders. Consequently, they ostracize her and force her to wear a
shameful symbol of her adulterya scarlet letter A embroidered prominently on a
piece of gold cloth. Despite the enormous social isolation and hardship she
endures, Hester raises Pearl lovingly, never gives into despair, and holds no
resentment against the rest of the community. Ultimately, the situation comes to
a head as the identities of both Hester's still-living husband and the father of her
child are revealed.
As a descendant of one of the original Puritan families of Salem, Massachusetts,
Hawthorne was painfully aware that the Puritans' austere way of life and
intolerant moral code often did more harm than good. Among his direct
ancestors was John Hathorne, one of the judges who condemned nearly twenty
people to death in the notorious Salem witch trials of 1692. Not surprisingly,
throughout The Scarlet Letter, Hawthorne unfavorably contrasts the Puritan
leaders' unfeeling severity with Hester's grace and selflessness.
The Scarlet Letter is richly symbolic and allegorical. Much of this symbolism is
overt and easily understood, making the novel popular among English teachers
who want to give their students an introduction to literary analysis. Hawthorne
had a knack for adding meaning and atmosphere through the names of his
characters, such as the guilt-ridden minister Arthur Dimmesdale and the
mysterious old doctor Roger Chillingworth. And the scarlet letter itself acts as
the novel's most complex symbol, initially a sign of Hester's shame and
alienation but ultimately a mark of her strength and integrity.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Hawthorne was born Nathaniel Hathorne but added a "w" to his name when
he first started publishing his writings.
2. One of Hawthorne's closest friends at Bowdoin College was Franklin Pierce,
who went on to become the fourteenth US president.
WEDNESDAY, DAY 3
Whistler's Mother
James McNeill Whistler's famous portrait-known simply as Whistler's Mother-
has become an iconic image of motherhood.
Whistler was born in Lowell, Massachusetts, in 1834. As a child, he lived
abroad, spending six years in Saint Petersburg, Russia, where his father worked
as a railroad engineer, and three in England. Upon his return to the States, he
enrolled at West Point. However, after failing a chemistry exam in his third year,
he was asked to leave. In 1854, Whistler moved to Washington DC and was
employed by the US Coast and Geodetic Survey, where he learned to etch. In
1855, he sailed for Europe and eventually settled in London.
Whistler's mother, Anna Matilda McNeill Whistler, came to live with him in
1863. He painted her portrait when his usual model fell ill. The work, which he
had entitled Arrangement in Grey and Black: Portrait of the Artist's Mother, was
exhibited at the Royal Academy in London in 1872. As the title of the work
suggests, Whistler considered the identity of his mother less important than the
formal elements of the composition. As he himself noted, "To me it is interesting
as a picture of my mother; but what can or ought the public to care about the
identity of the portrait? ... As music is the poetry of sound, so is painting the
poetry of sight, and subject matter has nothing to do with harmony of sound or
colour."
In the portrait, Anna wears a plain black dress and a white cap with translucent
lappets hanging down like the ears of a spaniel. Whistler used different types of
brushwork to convey different textures within the composition. He had originally
intended to portray his mother standing but changed his mind when she was
unable to pose for long enough periods of time. Anna's somber outfit was a sign
of mourning; she had worn black since her husband's death in Russia in 1849.
The painting was exhibited again in Paris in 1883 and bought by the French
government in 1890. It was initially displayed in the Musee du Luxembourg,
then, following museum policy, moved to the Louvre Museum ten years after
Whistler's death. Today it hangs in the Musee d'Orsay in Paris.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. The painting was featured on a 1934 United States postage stamp honoring the
mothers ofAmerica.
2. The painting has given rise to many caricatures with figures such as
Bullwinkle, Barbie, and Ronald Reagan posing as the mother.
3. Whistler preferred using coarse linen canvas, allowing excess paint to drip
freely.
THURSDAY, DAY 4
Circadian Rhythms
All living creatures have a built-in biological clock that controls wakefulness
and sleep, metabolism, heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature. The
pattern of our daily biological functions is set to a circadian rhythm, a 24hour
cycle. If we disrupt our built-in tempo by even a few hours, we feel the effects
immediately. Travelers who fly across the country often feel hot flashes, chills,
stomachaches, headaches, grogginess, irritability, and sudden bursts of energy
followed by fatigue. Jet lag has nothing to do with jets; it's the result of
tampering with the body's natural rhythm.
In mammals, the internal clock is located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN),
a collection of neurons in the hypothalamus, a part of the brain that regulates
body temperature, fluids and electrolytes, hunger, and hormone production. The
SCN is connected to the retina of the eye, where is takes in information about
light. If it is dark outside, the SCN tells the body to secrete melatonin, a hormone
that makes the body sleepy. If it is light outside, it inhibits melatonin production.
But the brain is slow to adjust to new environments. Although it can handle the
gradual change of the seasons, it didn't evolve to cope with changing time zones.
Hence, jet lag.
In the winter, the SCN responds to the prolonged darkness by producing
melatonin in two phases, one at the beginning of the night and one at the end of
the night. This causes many people to wake up in the middle of the night during
the winter, although they rarely feel a need to get out of bed. The net effect is
that, for many people, it takes more time to get a full night's sleep in winter. This
may be nature's way of getting us to stay under the covers longer when it's cold
outside.
If the SCN is destroyed by accident or disease, human beings cease to have
sleep/wake cycles completely. But if the SCN is healthy, even in the absence of
light, the body continues functioning in a free-running rhythm. Animals and
humans continue to sleep and to be awake for uninterrupted blocks of times, but
the body phases into a 25-hour cycle. This indicates to scientists that the SCN
does not depend entirely on cues from the outside world to keep time.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. The word circadian comes from the Latin for "about one day."
2. We sleep best when our body temperatures are the lowest, in the wee hours
ofthe morning. Our temperatures begin to rise between 6 a. m.
3. Body strength and pain tolerance peak in the afternoon.
4. Heart attacks are most likely to occur in the morning.
FRIDAY, DAY 5
Franz Schubert
At Beethoven's funeral in 1827, Franz Schubert (1797-1828) carried a torch in
mourning, a gesture laden with more symbolism than he would know. He died a
year later, carrying on the tradition of the tortured, devoted romantic composer
whose flame burned out early.
Born in Lichtenthal, a suburb of Vienna, Schubert studied violin, singing, and
piano as a young boy with Antonio Salieri, Mozart's main competition and one
of Beethoven's teachers. Schubert was obsessed with composition and spent long
hours every day sitting alone and writing. His father was a music teacher and
urged Franz to become one as well. Franz gave in to his father's pressure and
became a teacher in 1813 but spent most of his time composing, stopping only to
discipline any student who dared interrupt him.
Schubert was not a master of the symphony like so many romantics. Instead, he
started the German tradition of the romantic art song, or the lied. Schubert
composed over six hundred lieder in his lifetime, including Der Erlkonig (1820),
a dark and frightening song about an elfking whose appearance foretells the
death of a little boy, based on a poem by Goethe. The song cycle Winterreise
(1827) is considered Schubert's finest work.
Schubert was a typical romantic-era bohemian. Poor his whole life, but utterly
devoted to his music, he sold dozens of his songs for far less than they were
worth. Schubert would compose every morning for several hours and then spend
his evenings with a group of close friends who called themselves Schubertians.
They would perform Schubert's latest works, recite poetry, and drink heavily in
the beer gardens and cafes of Vienna.
Schubert was neither handsome nor particularly interested in women, but in
1822 he contracted syphilis, which was rampant among the prostitutes of central
Europe. He died at age thirtyone, far before his creative energies were expended.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. In 1823 Schubert started work on his famous Unfinished Symphony. When he
died, a friend, Anselm Hiittenbrenner, kept the manuscript hidden for thirty-
seven years. It premiered, to great acclaim, in Vienna in 1865.
2. Schubert often borrowed money from his friends and lived in their homes. He
almost never had his own lodgings.
3. Schubert used texts from Goethe and other contemporary German poets,
including Wilhelm Muller as the basis of his art songs.
SATURDAY, DAY 6
Idealism
In philosophy, an idealist is someone who believes that reality depends upon the
mind.
When idealists claim that something depends upon the mind, they are claiming
that the thing would not exist if there were not minds that thought of it. This is a
radical position. In ordinary life, we take it for granted that there is a world of
objects, and there is a way those objects are, independent of what we think about
them.
Idealists, such as the philosopher George Berkeley (1685-1753), rejected the
simple idea that there is a world of objects independent of human perception. He
argued that objects exist only when we aren't thinking about them because God
is thinking about them. Another form of idealism is transcendental idealism, the
position adopted by Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) and Arthur Schopenhauer
(1788-1860).
Kant acknowledged there are things that do not depend on the human mind for
their existence. Kant called them "things in themselves." However, he insisted
that the objects we actually experience are not the things in themselves, but the
mere appearance of those things in themselves. And that appearance exists only
in our minds. Schopenhauer accepted this Kantian distinction, but he denied that
there are multiple things in themselves. For Schopenhauer, the ultimate nature of
reality is a single, undifferentiated Will-a blind, striving force-which appears to
us as a world of individual things in space and time.
In contemporary philosophy, idealism is more often adopted with respect to
certain features of objects, rather than the existence of those objects. Thus, many
contemporary philosophers argue that values-like moral goodness and beauty,
etc.-are mind-dependent, that things in the world have values only because we
believe them to have values. Other philosophers are realists about value: They
hold that there is real moral goodness, moral badness, beauty, ugliness, etc., in
the world, whether we experience it or not.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Scholars used to think of the history ofphilosophy as a long debate between
realists and idealists. According to this line of thought, Aristotle (384-322 BC)
was the first realist and Plato (427-347 BC) was the first idealist. However, few
historians ofphilosophy would accept this today.
2. Schopenhauer claimed the origins of his transcendental idealism can be found
in the philosophy and literature of Hinduism.
SUNDAY, DAY 7
Joseph Smith and Mormonism
Joseph Smith was born into a Vermont farming family in 1805. In his early
teens, he claimed to have had his first vision, during which he saw Jesus Christ
and God the Father. Three years later, Smith was visited by the Angel Moroni
who told him that golden plates were hidden on his farm.
After years of being denied access to the plates, Moroni finally allowed Smith to
see and translate them beginning in 1827. It is believed that Smith translated the
plates, which were written in a form of ancient Egyptian, through divine
intervention. While dictating the translation to relatives, Smith rarely paused or
corrected himself.
The result of the translation was the Book of Mormon which, along with the
Bible, is accepted by Mormons as the word of God. The Book of Mormon tells
of an ancient prophet, Lehi, who was told by God to go to North America in 600
BC. In the Americas, the book recounts, God continued to choose prophets.
After translating the book and founding his new faith in 1830, Smith
immediately began spreading his religion, causing great unrest wherever he
went. He slowly but steadily moved west, from Vermont to New York and
Pennsylvania, to Missouri, and finally to Illinois. In 1844, Smith was imprisoned
on charges of suppressing a rival newspaper. He was subsequently killed by an
angry mob. After Smith's death, Brigham Young took over and moved the
Church farther west to Salt Lake City, Utah.
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints holds that it is not Orthodox,
Catholic, or Protestant, but rather the restoration of the original church that Jesus
Christ founded on earth. The Church believes that Smith was the first in a line of
recent prophets, followed by Young and continuing today with the current
president, prophet and seer of the church. This present-day prophet is believed to
have the power to receive direct messages from God.
Among the church's many doctrines are beliefs in the importance of chastity,
modest dress, and family prayer lessons. According to a diet code, known as the
Word of Wisdom, Mormons cannot consume alcohol, tobacco, coffee, or tea.
What they are perhaps most notorious for, though, is a form of polygamy known
as plural marriage. Ironically, polygamy was actually banned by the church in
1890.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. In Illinois, Smith founded the city ofNauvoo, which in 1845 rivaled the
population ofChicago.
2. The Mormons have the world's largest missionary program with 51,000 full-
time missionaries worldwide.
MONDAY, DAY I
Irish Potato Famine
In a single ten-year period from 1841 to 1851, hundreds of thousands of
impoverished farmers in Ireland starved to death in one of the worst famines in
modern European history. By some estimates, the population of the Emerald Isle
fell by 20 percent. The famine was a human catastrophe of tragic proportions
and had profound implications far beyond Ireland's shores. It prompted a huge
exodus of starving farmers from the island, many of whom migrated to the
United States to seek a better life, forming one of first major waves of
immigration into the States.
For generations, potatoes thrived in Ireland's soil and were the country's main
crop. In the 1840s, however, a potato fungus destroyed the potato plant and
sparked a widespread famine, as many Irish farmers had no other supply of food.
At the time the famine occurred, Ireland was a part of the United Kingdom, the
most powerful empire in the world, and many contemporaries and historians
believe that the British government was criminally negligent in allowing the
disaster to occur. One of Britain's most well-known satirists at the time, Jonathan
Swift, wrote a famous article called "A Modest Proposal," criticizing the
government's inadequate response to the crisis. He facetiously suggested that
since the government wasn't sending food, the Irish should eat their babies to
survive.
Ireland had been invaded by the English in 1169 AD. It remained a British
possession until finally winning independence in 1922, except for the six
counties of Northern Ireland that remain part of Great Britain. Disagreement
over whether Northern Ireland should remain British or become a part of the rest
of Ireland continues, although violence in the region has abated since the Good
Friday agreement in 1998.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Potatoes are not native to Ireland, or even to Europe. Spanish explorers
encountered Native American farmers growing the plant in South America and
brought the crop back to the Old World, where it quickly became popular.
2. The arrival ofIrish Catholic refugees in American cities during and after the
famine provoked an angry reaction from some Americans who feared the
United States would lose its Protestant religious character. Opponents of
immigration from Catholic countries formed a political party, the Know-
Nothings, which briefly flourished in the 1850s.
3. Irish immigration to the United States continued well into the twentieth
century. Today, according to the Census Bureau, thirty-four million Americans
claim Irish ancestry, nearly ten times the total population ofIreland.
TUESDAY, DAY 2
Walt Whitman
Walt Whitman (1819-1892) was the first great American poet and a significant
contributor to the country's emerging literary voice. His works were especially
influential in their pioneering of free verse, a poetic form that abandoned strict
meter and rhyme schemes in favor of more irregular, variable structures. Free
verse became a favorite of twentieth-century poets and is still in wide use today.
Whitman grew up in Brooklyn, where he worked as a teacher and journalist,
taking advantage of New York City's cultural offerings, especially the theater. In
his late twenties, he traveled through the Mississippi River region for several
months, getting a feel for the American heartland. When he returned to
Brooklyn, he wrote a large body of poems, publishing the first edition of his
collection, Leaves of Grass (1855), on his own dime.
Leaves of Grass is an exuberant work, filled with poems celebrating democracy,
brotherhood, the American landscape, and the human body. Due to its
occasionally racy physical descriptions and its undercurrent of ambiguous or
even overtly gay sexuality, many decried the work as obscene. The collection's
most famous poem is its first, "Song of Myself," which sets the tone of the entire
work from its opening lines:
Leaves of Grass displays many hallmarks of transcendentalism, which thanks to
Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau was sweeping American
artistic circles at the time. Originating in New England, transcendentalism was
an optimistic intellectual philosophy that emphasized individuality, self-reliance,
and the pursuit of a spiritual purity that transcended the concerns of the everyday
world.
Whitman revised Leaves of Grass repeatedly over his career, adding new poems
and editing existing ones, culminating in the authoritative deathbed edition that
appeared in 1892. Whitman's poems gradually became more serious, reflecting
his deep sadness about the Civil War and the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.
His heartbreaking elegy to Lincoln, "When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard
Bloom'd" (written 1865-1866), ranks among his finest poems.
WEDNESDAY, DAY 3
Edgar Degas
Edgar Degas (1834-1917) is one of the best-known artists associated with the
impressionist movement. Painter, draftsman, sculptor, photographer, and
collector, he became especially famous for his representations of ballerinas.
Born into a wealthy Parisian banking family, Degas initially intended to study
law. However, after making copies of paintings in the Louvre, he decided to
become an artist and began studying in 1854. Two years later, Degas moved to
Italy for several years, where he copied Old Master paintings and laid the
foundations of his later career. Drawn initially to classical subjects, Degas
nevertheless modeled his figures on real bodies. His early work Young Spartans
Exercising (1860) places an ancient theme in a contemporary setting.
Like many artists of his generation, Degas was deeply affected by the invention
of photography. He experimented with the camera and often used it to make
preparatory studies for his paintings. He was likewise influenced by Japanese
prints, notable for their lack of symmetry and centralized compositions. Inspired
by the realist painters Gustave Courbet and l:douard Manet, whom he met in
1861, he began painting the everyday life of Paris.
Between 1865 and 1874, Degas developed his own personal style, one that tried
to capture subjects with dispassionate objectivity. In Interior (or The Rape),
painted in 1868-70, Degas made the viewer feel as if he or she were intruding on
a private moment. Degas submitted works to seven of the impressionists'
exhibitions. Although he supported the movement from its inception, he disliked
the term impressionism and referred to himself as a realist or naturalist.
Degas reached the height of his powers between 1880 and 1893. Experimenting
with various media, he combined pastel with tempera or gouache to achieve
more fluid effects. Influenced by the Socialist views of the famous author smile
Zola, he painted sympathetic portraits of laborers, as can be seen in Women
Ironing of 1884. After the final impressionist exhibition of 1886, Degas stopped
displaying his work in group shows and worked instead with private dealers. In
his later years, he tended to work in brighter, less natural colors. Depressed by
his failing eyesight, Degas stopped painting in 1912, five years before his death.
The most critical assessment of Degas's work came from the artist himself, who
once wrote in a letter: "I was, or I seemed, hard toward all the world, because of
a kind of attraction toward brutality that came from my doubt and bad temper."
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. In October of 1872, Degas left Paris for a five-month stay in New Orleans,
birthplace ofhis mother. In 1873, hepaintedNew Orleans Cotton Office.
2. Degas also wrote poetry, mostly in the form ofsonnets.
THURSDAY, DAY 4
Sleep
It seems strange that human beings evolved to spend about one-third of their
lives lying unconscious, completely vulnerable to predators. But sleep is as
crucial to our survival as food, water, and shelter. After one night without sleep,
we become tired and cranky. After two nights, we suffer from memory loss and
diminished concentration. After three nights, delirium sets in. Although a
healthy human being can survive without eating for more than a month, humans
die without sleep in less than two weeks.
So what is so important about sleep? Although no one is sure, it seems clear that
sleep restores our muscles and organs, organizes our thoughts, and builds
memories. According to electroencephalograph (EEG) studies that measure the
activity of electrical waves in the brain, sleep occurs in stages. Normally when
we are awake and not thinking of anything in particular, the brain generates
alpha waves that oscillate at about ten cycles per second. When we concentrate
deeply, we exhibit beta waves, which are twice as fast.
As we enter the first stage of sleep, the alpha waves become random, their
rhythm coming and going. In this stage of light dozing, we can be easily
awakened. As time passes, brain waves become longer and slower. After about
forty minutes, we generate delta waves that oscillate less than 3.5 times per
second. In this stage of deep sleep, the muscles of the body regenerate
themselves, and it is very hard to wake up. Brain waves begin to quicken again,
climbing back to alpha levels in another forty minutes or so. But instead of
waking up, the body enters a stage called rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The
eyes twitch back and forth, as if they are looking at a moving object. It is during
this stage of sleep that we dream. The average young adult experiences four or
five periods of REM sleep per night.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Depriving a person ofREMsleep will quickly lead to delirium.
2. Babies spend more than half the night in REM sleep.
3. Cows can sleep standing up, but they can only dream lying down.
4. Whales and dolphins have to swim and breathe as they sleep, so only one-half
of their brains fall asleep at a time.
FRIDAY, DAY 5
Felix Mendelssohn
Born to a wealthy Jewish banker and a mother with great artistic talents, Felix
Mendelssohn (1809-1847) excelled in both music and the visual arts. In fact,
some of his finest works, such as A Midsummer Night's Dream (1826) and
Scotch Symphony (1830-1842) can be described as the musical equivalent of
impressionist paintings-full of ripe symbolism and imitations of both natural and
fantastical sounds.
As a young man, Mendelssohn studied with Karl Zelter, a prominent German
music teacher and a devotee of Bach. Mendelssohn studied fugue form
intensively, and in his early twenties he conducted a performance of Bach's St.
Matthew Passion that was so well-received, it is said to have touched off a
continental revival of Bach's works. During the subsequent tour, Mendelssohn
visited Scotland, which inspired him to write several works including his famous
Scotch Symphony. At age twenty-seven, Mendelssohn married and became the
director of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra.
Much of Mendelssohn's music has magical themes, evident in the "faerie
dances" of his Octet for Strings (1825) and his incidental music for the play A
Midsummer Night's Dream. He was also a very strict classical formalist, with
very little of the romantic fire that drove most of his colleagues. He was widely
praised as a master musical craftsman.
For several years, Mendelssohn maintained a harrowing schedule of concerts
and teaching. By 1846, when his oratorio Elijah premiered in London,
Mendelssohn had worn himself ragged. He retreated to Frankfurt to rest. Once
there, he learned that his beloved sister Fanny had died, and he immediately had
a fit that resulted in a broken blood vessel in his head. He emerged from the
incident morose and creatively lifeless and wrote few pieces until he died, in a
deep depression, the following year.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. As a young boy, Mendelssohn's father Abraham converted the whole family to
Protestant Christianity because he thought that widespread German anti-
Semitism would inhibit his son's artistic career. The new family surname was
Mendelssohn-Bartholdy.
2. Mendelssohn's firstteacher, Zelter, was a personal friend ofthepoetGoethe,
who came to adoreMendelssohn music and often invited the twelve-year-old to
play for him.
3. The composer's grandfather, Moses Mendelssohn, was a renowned
philosopher.
4. Mendelssohn wrote the famous "Wedding March" that has since accompanied
thousands of bridal parties out of chapels.
SATURDAY, DAY 6
David Hume
Born in Scotland, David Hume (1711-1776) broke with the Calvinism of his
youth and developed controversial views on morality and religion. His
reputation as a radical prevented him from finding work at a university. Instead,
Hume was employed as, among other things, a clerk, a librarian, and later a
diplomat. He spent time in the salons of Paris, where he met Jean-Jacques
Rousseau and Denis Diderot. Hume died in 1776; he had arranged for his most
controversial work, Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, to be published
after his death.
Hume's philosophy is notable for its empiricism and skepticism. Hume believed
that all of our knowledge and ideas begin with experience. He demanded that
some experience justify every philosophical concept. And he exhibited a
remarkable willingness to discredit not merely articles of religious faith, but
widespread philosophical assumptions. Most famously and influentially, Hume
attacked the idea that we can rely on inductive reasoning (induction) to lead us
toward true beliefs.
In the realm of moral philosophy, Hume held that only desires, not beliefs,
motivate human beings to act. But he observed that moral principles do drive our
behavior. Therefore he concluded those principles must appeal not to our beliefs,
but to our desires. In other words, Hume argued moral judgments do not express
objective features of the world, but simply record our preferences. He believed
all of us have a natural moral sentiment, which makes us dislike certain acts and
approve of others. When we make moral judgments, we are simply expressing
our approval or disapproval and nothing more lofty than that.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. In the posthumously published Dialogues on Natural Religion Hume criticized
various articles of traditional religious faith, especially the argument that God
designed the world.
2. To express his view that desires cannot be evaluated rationally, Hume wrote,
"7t is not contrary to reason to prefer the destruction ofthe whole world to the
scratching of my finger."
SUNDAY, DAY 7
Muhammad
Muhammad was the final prophet of God on earth, according to followers of
Islam. Like all Arabs, Muhammad's lineage can be traced back to Ishmael, the
first son of Abraham. Muslims believe that Muhammad's revelations followed
those of other prophets such as Moses and Jesus Christ.
Muhammad was born in Mecca circa 570 CE. At the time, Mecca was a thriving
city, centered around a temple called the Kaaba where idolatry was practiced.
Muhammad's father died before he was born, and as a young boy, Muhammad
traveled around Arabia with his merchant uncle, later following in that trade.
Around the age of forty, Muhammad, who was known to be reflective and
contemplative, went to the cave of al-Hira, near Mecca, where he had a vision.
In this vision, the angel Gabriel spoke to him and commanded him to memorize
and recite verses, which later made up the Quran. Gabriel visited Muhammad
throughout his remaining twenty-three years, and Muhammad began to preach
Gabriel's teachings. Throughout his whole life, however, Muhammad was
illiterate, meaning that all of his revelations had to be passed along by the
spoken word.
A central tenet of Muhammad's teachings was monotheism. This concept greatly
angered the powerful leaders of Mecca as their town thrived on the idol-based
Kaaba. Eventually, Muhammad was forced to flee with his followers to Medina.
In Medina, Islam quickly became the majority. However, rather than banish non-
Muslims, Muhammad allowed them to pay a tax in order to continue their
religious practices.
As Medina's power increased, the city of Mecca became wary. Tensions
increased, and eventually the two cities waged war. Muhammad and Medina,
despite being outnumbered, emerged victorious. Muhammad then unified all of
Arabia through further conquests.
Muhammad died in Medina in 632 at age sixty-three. According to oral tradition,
at the time of Muhammad's death, the angel Gabriel once again appeared before
him. Gabriel took Muhammad on his horse from Mecca to Jerusalem. There
Muhammad met Abraham, Moses, and Jesus, before riding the angel's horse into
heaven, thus ascending to his final resting place. This final ascension occurred
from the Temple Mount, now the third holiest site in Islam (after Mecca and
Medina).
The question of who Muhammad chose as his successor is a subject of debate
and led to the schism between Shiite and Sunni Muslims. According to Sunni
Islam, Abu Bakr was chosen as the next caliph. Shiite, on the other hand, claim
that Muhammad appointed Ali, his son-inlaw, as the next caliph, and that Abu
Bakr rose to power only by overthrowing him.
MONDAY, DAY 1
Colonialism
Spanish colonization of the Americas began with the voyage of Christopher
Columbus in 1492. British traders and religious refugees arrived in the New
World a century later. But the era of European colonization did not end in the
seventeenth century and did not stop with America. British merchants and
colonizers in the age of exploration roamed across the globe, founding new
settlements in India, China, and the islands of the Pacific Ocean.
In the late 1800s, the major European powers-France, Britain, and Germany-"
discovered" Africa. In the span of a few decades, leading European nations
divided up Africa and subjugated its indigenous population to colonial control.
France took big chunks of western Africa. Britain wrested control of South
Africa and much of the east coast of the continent. Germany, Portugal, and
Belgium staked claims on smaller portions of Africa.
Insatiable greed coupled with a desire to spread Western civilization fired the
imagination of the European colonial powers. Armed with new technologies
such as the railroad, which made it easier to tame the vast spaces of Africa, the
West set out to harness the resources of the continent. In the infamous words of
British poet Rudyard Kipling, the European empires had selflessly assumed the
"white man's burden" of spreading civilization-and earning a tidy profit.
For the inhabitants of Africa, the coming of the Europeans was a disaster. Many
Europeans considered black Africans barely human, and they exterminated huge
parts of the African population. In his famous 1902 novel, Heart of Darkness,
author Joseph Conrad illustrated how colonialism turned allegedly civilized
Europeans into monsters, exploiting and killing African natives. In some
territories, millions died. In the Belgian Congo, it has been estimated that ten
million were worked to death; a whole population was targeted for extermination
in German Southwest Africa after rebelling against colonial rule. Europeans did
not abandon their hold on Africa until after World War II, leaving a shattered and
impoverished continent.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Just before the outbreak of World War I, only two small parts ofAfrica
remained free and independent: Ethiopia and Liberia, a small nation in
WestAfrica that had been founded by freedArnerican slaves in 1847
2. Most European powers letgo oftheirAfrican colonies peacefully after World
War II, butFrance tenaciously tried to hold Algeria, a country on the
Mediterranean coast. In a bloody war thatlasted from the mid-1950s until 1962,
hundreds of thousands ofAlgerians were killed before the country finally won
independence. The revolt was portrayed in the famous 1966 movie Battle
ofAlgiers.
3. During the mid-nineteenth century, British explorer David Livingstone
traveled Africa looking for the source of the Nile river. His expedition lost
contact with the outside world for six years, until journalist Henry Morton
Stanley located him in Tanzania in 1871, famously greeting the explorer with
the words, "Dr. Livingstone, I presume?"
TUESDAY, DAY 2
Charles Dickens
Few novelists have even come close to matching the productivity and celebrity
of Charles Dickens (1812-1870). His enormous body of work consists of more
than fifteen major novels-many of them huge tomes-and innumerable
journalistic and editorial pieces. Although detractors ridiculed Dickens's work as
unliterary, he ignored such criticism and found fulfillment as a socially
conscious storyteller. In return, an adoring public held Dickens up as one of the
most beloved figures of the Victorian era.
Dickens spent his childhood in Chatham and London, where his father clerked in
the public service. When his parents' overzealous spending landed them in
debtors' prison, the twelve-year-old Dickens was forced to drop out of school
and take a job in a bootblacking factory-an experience that gave him the lifelong
empathy for the poor that is evident throughout his writings. Once Dickens was
able to leave the factory, he finished his brief education and worked as a law
clerk and, later, a journalist.
Dickens's first published novel, The Pickwick Papers (1836), launched him to
instant fame. Like many of his works, it was published serially in a monthly
magazine, which gave him a greater financial windfall. Dickens wrote at a
breakneck pace over the next five years, producing four more serialized novels,
including the now-classic Oliver Twist (1837-1839), a tale of a young orphan
living on the streets.
Each new work brought Dickens greater public acclaim, from his morality tale A
Christmas Carol (1843) to his own "favourite child," the partly autobiographical
David Copperfield (1849-1850). Although all of these works demonstrated
concern with poverty and other social ills, these concerns grew more serious in
later novels, particularly Bleak House (1852-1853), about the inefficiency of the
English legal system, and Hard Times (1854), about the dark side of
industrialization. Dickens's career culminated with the historical novel A Tale of
Two Cities (1859) and the comic tale Great Expectations (1860-1861).
The quality of Dickens's works varies considerably, from masterful fiction to
maudlin plots awash in sentimentality. The fact that Dickens published his
novels serially-and that he was often paid by the word-accounts for much of this
inconsistency. But Dickens always worked with the conscious aim of pleasing
his readership, even if that meant quantity over quality. His works continue to
please readers today.
ADDITIONAL FACT
1. Dickens's prolificacy was not limited to his writing; he also had ten children
by his wife, Catherine Hogarth.
WEDNESDAY, DAY 3
Paul Cezanne
Paul Cezanne (1839-1906) is considered one of the major artists of the
postimpressionist movement. His landscapes and still lifes were influential on
the development of Cubism and Fauvism in the early twentieth century.
Born into a wealthy French family in Aix-en-Provence, Cezanne initially studied
law near his hometown. There he first met the novelist Fmile Zola, with whom
he became close friends. Abandoning law for painting in 1861, Cezanne moved
to Paris, where he was rejected from the Fcole des Beaux-Arts. He then began
studying at the Academic Suisse, where he met Camille Pissarro, who was to
become a lifelong influence on his work. In 1874, Cezanne joined the
impressionists in their first independent exhibition, to which he submitted
Modern Olympia. His entry was dismissed by one unsympathetic critic as a
work of "unbridled romanticism."
Although Cezanne exhibited with the impressionists twice more, he continued to
submit paintings-all of which were rejected-to the official Salon. Critical of what
he considered the impressionists' neglect of form and structure, Cezanne wrote to
a friend, "I want to make of impressionism something valid and lasting, like the
art in the museums" He thus developed his own style, which was later
categorized as postimpressionism. He simplified forms and distorted perspective
to capture what he believed was a truer perception of reality. In Fruit Bowl,
Glass and Apples (1879-1882), for example, Cezanne made the stem of the bowl
slightly off center, as if it was supporting the unbalanced weight of the fruit.
In 1882, Cezanne moved back to his childhood home in Aix. In his later period,
he reduced the importance of subject matter, concentrating instead on pure form.
Working his way toward abstraction, Cezanne noted in a letter, "You must see in
nature the cylinder, the sphere, the cone, all put in perspective, so that every side
of an object, of a plane, recedes to a central point." After 1900, he painted a
series of views of nearby Mont Sainte-Victoire using blocks of color and shifting
points of view to capture the feeling, rather than the objective reality, of the
landscape.
When Cezanne died in 1906, Pablo Picasso had already begun his cubist
masterpiece, Les Demoiselles d Avignon. The composition owed a great deal to
Cezanne.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. C2zanne ended his friendship with Emile Zola in 1886 when, in the French
journal Le Figaro, the novelist described the artist as an abortedgreat talent.
3. Picasso called Cdzanne "the father of us all."
THURSDAY, DAY 4
Blood
The average adult has about five liters of blood flowing through his or her veins.
But what exactly is blood? It consists of four essential components that help the
body survive: red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and plasma.
Red blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to all the tissues in the body.
Normally, these cells are shaped like donuts with the holes partially filled in, but
they can change shape in order to squeeze through tiny capillaries. In addition to
delivering oxygen, red blood cells pick up carbon dioxide, a waste product of
cellular respiration. When red blood cells are carrying oxygen, they are bright
red, giving blood its characteristic color. Deoxygenated blood is a dark maroon
color, but because of the way light penetrates our skin, it appears blue in our
veins.
White blood cells are a part of the immune system that fights infections, killing
bacteria, viruses, and parasites. There are many types of white blood cells, but
the most common types are neutrophils and lymphocytes. Neutrophils literally
swallow their enemies alive. They break them down and digest them in a process
called phagocytosis. Lymphocytes work in more subtle and complex ways. They
refine their shape to destroy new viruses and bacteria that enter the body.
Although this takes time, lymphocytes remember past encounters with old
diseases. Once they learn to fight a certain germ, they always know how to
defeat it again.
Platelets, the third component of blood, contain chemicals that clot wounds.
When you scrape or cut yourself, platelets help form the scab that stops the
bleeding. Red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets are all formed in bone
marrow from the same stem cells.
Plasma is the fluid that carries red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets
throughout the body. It is 90 percent water and 10 percent a mixture of proteins,
electrolytes, glucose, vitamins, hormones, and cholesterol. Altogether, blood
contains everything that keeps the body alive.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. On average, men have 5,200, 000 red blood cells per cubic millimeter while
women have 4,600,000 red blood cells per cubic millimeter.
2. Frozen blood can keep for up to ten years.
3. Jewish dietary laws do not allow blood to be consumed in any way.
Traditionally, salting and pickling purges blood from meat.
4. According to Chinese folklore, nosebleeds are a sign ofsexual arousal in men.
FRIDAY, DAY 5
Hector Berlioz
Romantic almost to a fault, Hector Berlioz (1803-1869) was egocentric and
constantly in love. His turbulent life was the perfect accompaniment to the music
he wrote.
Born into a modest family outside of Grenoble, France, Berlioz's doctor father
sent him to medical school in Paris. There he was swept up in the spirit of
romanticism, going to concerts and hanging around musicians. Against the
urgings of his pious and practical mother, Berlioz abandoned his studies and
entered the Paris Conservatory.
In 1827, Berlioz attended a performance of Shakespeare's Hamlet that would
change his life. He fell madly in love with the Irish actress Harriet Smithson,
who played the leading role of Ophelia, and began a crazed courtship. When
Smithson rejected Berlioz's advances, he decided to win her over with music.
The result was the programmatic Symphonic Fantastique (1830), one of the most
important pieces of the nineteenth century.
The work tells the story of a young, ambitious composer who, smitten by a
beautiful maiden, tries to commit suicide by overdosing on opium. Instead of
dying, he tumbles through five hectic hallucinations, which coincide with the
five movements of the piece: First he meets his lover and is overcome by desire;
then he sees her dancing at a ball; next is a tranquil scene in a pasture; then he
murders his coveted and is executed by guillotine; finally, the composer's body is
tossed around at a witches' Sabbath, where his dead lover reappears in ghoulish
form, accompanied by a distortion of her theme and the medieval chant for the
dead, the "Dies Irae."
Symphonie Fantastique uses the revolutionary technique of the idee fixe, a
simple, captivating melody representing the beloved, that is repeated within new
musical guises in each movement. As Berlioz was obsessed with Harriet's
memory, his symphony is obsessed with this theme. Many years later, Berlioz
eventually married the fickle Harriet, but their cooled, overdue love did not last
long.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. jean-Francois Lesueur, Berlioz's teacher at the Paris Conservatory, told him he
was a genius. Berlioz never forgot itencouraging his Babylonian instincts to
compose on a grand scale, mounting huge, expensive productions. In Paris in
1844, he conducteda massive orchestral/choral ensemble that numbered more
than 1,000 musicians and required seven assistant conductors.
2. Beyond teaching himself guitar and flute, Berlioz lacked instrumental
prowess. He was a terrible pianist and didn't play the violin or any of the other
usual instruments of composers.
3. Constantly at odds with the demanding, conservative standards ofthe Paris
Conservatory-Berlioz applied for a job there but was repeatedly rejected-he
made most of his living writing criticism for Parisian newspapers and
magazines. He was a talented writer, and many ofhis articles survive today.
SATURDAY, DAY 6
Induction
When we reason from the way things have been in the past to draw conclusions
about the way they always are, or always will be, we are reasoning inductively.
For instance, we believe that the sun will rise tomorrow, because the sun has
always risen in the past. Likewise, we believe that all books have pages, because
all of the books we have ever seen have pages. Most of the beliefs we have about
the world are based on inductive reasoning.
Induction is not as certain as deductive reasoning. We reason deductively when,
for instance, we conclude that because Socrates is a man, and all men are mortal,
therefore Socrates is mortal. In this case, the facts make the conclusion true.
However, when using induction, the facts about the past don't settle how the
future will be. The sun might explode or in some other way fail to rise.
When employing inductive reasoning, one might argue the evidence doesn't
entail the conclusion, but it makes the conclusion probable or likely. Still the
problem remains: What justification do we have for assuming that the future
will, more likely than not, be like the past?
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. David Hume (1711-1776) first raised the problem of induction. He concluded
that there is no reason to think that inductive reasoning will guide us to the
truth.
2. In the 1950s, philosopher Nelson Goodman (1906-1998) raised what he called
the new riddle ofinduction: What features of things are legitimate bases for
inductive reasoning, and which are not?
SUNDAY, DAY 7
Quran
The Quran is the holy book of Muslims and is believed to be God's final
revelation to mankind. It was transmitted from God to the angel Gabriel to the
prophet Muhammad, and finally to all Muslims.
The Quran contains 114 suras (chapters) and more than 6,200 ayat (verses).
Since Muhammad was illiterate, his revelations had to be spoken aloud and
written down by someone else.
The original language of the Quran was an ancient form of Arabic. Arabic is a
language of consonants and no vowels; therefore the meanings of words and
phrases can easily be lost and reinterpreted over time. The ancient style of the
Quran is revered, and its Arabic is seen as ideal because it is the speech of God.
Moreover, it is believed that in order for the Quran to be truly understood, it
must always be written in Arabic. Thus, translated versions of the holy book are
considered mere summaries or approximations.
Muslim scholars consider the Quran to be a genre in itself. In various suras, the
Quran contains everything from prose and verse to rhyming schemes and
refrains. One hundred and thirteen suras begin with the words "In the name of
God, the Merciful, the Compassionate."
The content of the suras also varies greatly. They contain narrative stories, legal
and ethical teachings, psychological teachings regarding the nature of humans,
and cosmological teachings regarding the nature of God. The Quran was not
written in chronological order, but instead it is roughly arranged by the size of
the sura, with the longest suras first. Furthermore, the Quran can be divided into
those revelations Muhammad had in Mecca and those he had in Medina. While
the Mecca sura tend to be shorter, the Medina sura tend to be longer and about
legal issues.
Uthman ibn Affan, the third of the Four Righteously Guided Caliphs according
to Sunni Islam, set out to codify the Quran. Because it was mostly told orally,
many versions of the written Quran had been created. In order to form an official
Quran, Uthman gathered many scholars, compiled multiple texts into one
standard version, sent this version to the extremities of the Arabic empire, and
had all other versions destroyed.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Several contradictions arise in the Quran, but Muslim scholars claim that these
"errors" were merely attempts by God to reveal the path that Muhammad and all
Muslims should take at a moderate pace.
2. People who have memorized the Quran are known as Hajzz (singular) or
Haffuz (plural), meaning "Guardians."
MONDAY, DAY I
Andrew Jackson
Andrew Jackson (1767-1845) was the seventh president of the United States,
holding office from 1829 to 1837. He was, in his time, certainly the most
unusual man to win the American presidency. Born in South Carolina, Jackson
joined the Continental Army to fight the British when he was only thirteen. He
worked as a lawyer and politician in Tennessee in the years following American
independence, then rejoined the state militia and led American forces to a
surprise victory over the British at the Battle of New Orleans in the War of 1812.
Jackson's military exploits made him a national hero. But his uncouth biography-
Jackson killed several legal adversaries in duels in Tennessee and married a
divorced woman-made him an unlikely candidate for the presidency, which had
up to 1829 been occupied by wellbred members of the Massachusetts and
Virginia elite.
Partly because of Jackson's background, he lost his first race for the presidency
in the controversial election of 1824 to John Quincy Adams, the grandee of a
Massachusetts political family and the son of President John Adams. At the time,
the American presidential election system was less democratic than it is today.
Many states did not give voters any say at all. Instead, state legislators appointed
electors who, in turn, voted for president at the Electoral College. In the states
that permitted a popular vote in 1824, Jackson defeated Adams handily. But
when the House of Representatives eventually decided the winner, it chose
Adams instead.
Enraged, Jackson spent the next four years campaigning to make the electoral
system more democratic. He founded a new political party to advance his cause,
the Democrats, and in the election of 1828 he defeated Adams easily. Jackson's
election heralded a shift in the American political system. No longer would
wealthy aristocrats have exclusive hold on the White House. As president,
Jackson pushed to expel Native Americans from Georgia and abolish the Bank
of the United States, causes popular among the newly enfranchised voters who
had made him the nation's first democratic president.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Since 1928-the 100th anniversary of his election Jackson's face has graced the
twenty-dollar bill. It is an ironic honor given Jackson's fierce opposition to the
Bank of the United States, an early predecessor of the Federal Reserve.
2. Jackson claimed to follow the example of Thomas Jefferson, but the stately
Virginian was no fan ofthe violenttempered Tennessean. `His passions are
terrible, "Jefferson wrote ofjackson. 'He is a dangerous man."
3. As president, Jackson argued that no state could override federal laws or
secede from the union. This doctrine of the inviolability of the union helped
shape the thinking of many Americans, including Abraham Lincoln.
TUESDAY, DAY 2
Henry James
In the late nineteenth century, as the United States established itself as a world
power to rival Europe, authors on both sides of the Atlantic began to chronicle
the inevitable collision between the Old World and the New. The most insightful
of these observers was Henry James (1843-1916).
As a native-born American but later a naturalized British citizen, James
embodied the expatriate experience. He was born in New York City to a
scholarly family: his father, Henry, was a prominent theorist and theologian, and
his elder brother, William, would go on to become a renowned philosopher.
James benefited from an extraordinarily cosmopolitan upbringing, living in
London, Paris, and Geneva at various points until his family settled in Newport,
Rhode Island. While studying at Harvard Law School, James penned stories and
book reviews before devoting himself to writing full time. James continued to
travel extensively throughout Europe during his twenties and thirties, believing it
would improve his writing.
James's first major novel, The American (1877), explores the conflict that would
pervade many of his works: New World brashness and naivete versus Old World
urbanity and corruption. In the novel, a new-money American businessman gets
in over his head amid the backstabbing and hauteur of the French aristocracy,
leading inevitably to disaster. Likewise, in Daisy Miller (1879), a willful young
American woman scorns the conventions of expatriate high society, bringing
herself only tragedy. And in A Portrait of a Lady (1881), an American heiress
falls victim to predatory expatriates in Europe.
Beyond his keen eye for the habits of the international set, James had great skills
as a prose stylist. His preference for long, twisting sentences was evident
throughout his career but particularly in his later novels, such as The
Ambassadors (1903). All of James's works demonstrate intense attention to
detail. He paid special attention to the psychological motivations of his
characters and the power dynamics of interpersonal relationships. In this regard,
though James's novels fall solidly in the nineteenth century tradition of realism,
he is seen as an early forerunner of the psychological novels of the twentieth
century.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. James published several collections ofnon fiction travel writings, including A
Little Tour in France (1884), English Hours (1905), and Italian Hours (1909).
2. After decades of living in Europe, James finally decided to become a British
citizen in 1915. He died in London the following year.
3. The film company Merchant Ivory Productions made several successful
adaptations of James's novels, including The Europeans (1979), The
Bostonians (1984), and The Golden Bowl (2000).
WEDNESDAY, DAY 3
Auguste Rodin
Auguste Rodin (1840-1917) is considered by many to be the last great sculptor
of realistic human figures. Best known for such monumental works as The
Thinker, Rodin emulated the flow and size of Michelangelo's massive unfinished
masterpieces.
Rodin received his earliest training at the Petite Ecole in Paris, where he studied
drawing between 1854 to 1857. Rejected by the Academy, Rodin was forced to
earn his living as a craftsman, ceramic painter, and jeweler during much of his
early career. In 1864, he entered the studio of Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse.
That same year he completed The Man with the Broken Nose, a work that
revealed his interest in naturalism, but it was rejected by the official Salon as
unfinished. In 1870, he followed Carrier-Belleuse to Brussels, where he
eventually formed an independent workshop and struggled to become a
recognized sculptor.
In 1875, a trip to Italy exposed Rodin to the sculptures of Michelangelo,
Donatello, and classical antiquity. In response, he created The Age of Bronze
(1875), a work so life-like that some believed it was made from the cast of a real
man.
In 1880, Rodin received a commission from the French government for the
bronze doors of the Musee des Arts Decoratifs. Inspired by Lorenzo Ghiberti's
famous Gates of Paradise on the Baptistery in Florence, Rodin cast more than
180 figures for his Gates of Hell, left unfinished at the time of his death.
In 1884, the citizens of Calais asked Rodin to create a monument honoring six
men who had sacrificed their lives to end the English siege of their city in 1347.
The result, The Burghers of Calais, was criticized for depicting the men as
victims rather than heroes. In 1891, when Rodin received a commission for a
portrait of Balzac, he spent seven years collecting daguerreotypes of the man,
consulted his tailor, and even studied the topography around his home to get a
feel for the author's personality. Like The Burghers of Calais, however, the work
was deemed too unconventional. Rodin responded by proclaiming, "My
principle is to imitate not only form, but life." Despite his critics, Rodin
continued to receive important commissions from the French government.
By 1895, Rodin had bought the Villa des Brillants, where he lived as a European
celebrity and received honorary degrees from foreign universities. In 1908, he
moved into the Hotel Biron in Paris, a building that was designated as the future
Musee Rodin in 1916, a year before the artist's death. Converted into a museum
in 1919, it continues to house the largest collection of Rodin's work in the world.
ADDITIONAL FACT
1. German poet Rainer Maria Rilke served as Rodin's secretary from 1905 to
1906 and later wrote a book abouthim.
THURSDAY, DAY 4
Batteries
Batteries are essentially storehouses for electrochemicals, substances that react
with each other to produce electrons, tiny negatively charged subatomic
particles. The flow of electrons from one source to another creates the electrical
currents that power our lamps, televisions, cars, cameras, satellites, and
computers. Electrons flow through conductive paths called circuits. The wires in
your house are examples of circuits.
Most batteries have four parts: a negatively charged anode, a positively charged
cathode, electrochemicals, and electrolytes. The reaction of electrochemicals
pushes electrons to one side of the battery, creating the anode (usually marked
with a minus sign). The lack of electrons on the other side of the battery creates
the cathode (usually marked with a positive sign). Normally, the electrons would
flow straight from the anode to the cathode to balance out the charge, but
electrolytes in the middle of the battery act like a blockade. They prevent
electrons from flowing from one side to another. Instead, the electrons must
travel through a circuit connecting the anode and the cathode.
If the anode and the cathode are connected to each other directly, the
electrochemicals will produce electrons as fast as possible, and the battery will
lose its charge quickly. But most batteries are connected to an electrical load-a
lamp, a TV, a radio-which allows the electrons to flow gradually. However,
eventually the electrochemicals will stop producing electrons. In rechargeable
batteries, an outside power source reverses the flow of electrons, causing the
electrochemicals to work in reverse and restoring the balance of electrons in the
anode and the cathode. This is what happens to the battery in your cell phone
when you plug it into the charger at night.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. There is evidence that there may have been primitive batteries in Baghdad as
early as 250 BC.
2. The first modern battery was invented by Alessandro Volta in 1800. The
words voltage and volt are derived from his name.
3. A new type ofbattery called powerpaper is currently being perfected. It is a
thin,flexible battery in the form of ink cells that can be printed on most
surfaces and produce power.
4. Worldwide, the battery industry generates forty-eight billion dollars in sales
each year.
FRIDAY, DAY 5
Robert and Clara Schumann
Robert Schumann's (1810-1856) life was marked by his creative genius and also
by the suffering that accompanied his mental instability. Married to Clara Wieck
Schumann (1819-1896), herself a famous pianist, he composed expressive songs
and chamber music in between bouts of illness, insanity, and incarceration in
mental institutions.
Robert and Clara met when she was nine years old and he was studying piano
with her father, Friedrich Wieck, in Leipzig. Robert had given up a career in law
to pursue music, and at the time he was editing the New Journal of Music, a
German magazine that attacked "musical philistines" and championed Berlioz,
Chopin, and later, Brahms.
In 1840, Robert and Clara were married against her father's wishes. Wieck
doubted Robert's stability as the young man had suffered frequent mental
breakdowns-probably a result of syphilis-and had attempted suicide in 1833. In
the first year of their marriage, Robert composed 140 lieder, or romantic songs,
in honor of their love. Clara was a virtuoso concert pianist in her own right, and
she trained some of the era's best soloists. She also wrote several pieces of her
own.
But their marriage soon became tense and trying. At Clara's urging, Robert wrote
two symphonies in 1841-the first highly acclaimed and the second not so well-
received. Clara also encouraged Robert to become a conductor, but he had little
talent and often got lost in the score while standing before an orchestra. To make
matters worse, his breakdowns were becoming more frequent. When he was
invited by his friend Felix Mendelssohn to teach at the newly formed Leipzig
Conservatory, he performed terribly-his lectures were vague and
incomprehensible-and he had to quit.
In 1844, Clara accompanied Robert on an extended European tour where he had
a crippling breakdown that convinced them to move to Dusseldorf for five years.
Between 1853 and 1855, Robert started going quietly insane, hearing voices in
his head and sitting alone at cafes at night, whistling to himself in the corner. In
1854 he tried to kill himself by jumping in the Rhine and was committed to an
asylum, where he died two years later.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. One legend is that Robert Schumann had to stop playing piano as a young
man because he paralyzed one of his fingers, supposedly by using a finger-
strengthening device. It is more likely that the paralysis was the result ofthe
mercury used to treat syphilis.
2. Robert Schumann created two characters to express the two sides of his
nature: Eusebius (contemplative, dreamy) and Florestan (impetuous, lively).
SATURDAY, DAY 6
Causation
A man throws a brick at a window, and the window breaks. The brick caused the
window to break. We think of the world in terms of things causing other things
to happen. But what does it truly mean for one thing to cause another to happen?
One answer is to say: X causes Y when events like X are usually followed by
events like Y. This is called a regularity theory of causation. However, this
theory is flawed. Every day, bakers wake up before the sun rises in order to bake
bread. But bakers getting out of bed do not cause the sun to rise. The fact that
events of a certain kind often follow each other does not mean they cause each
other.
Another theory: X causes Y when if X did not happen, Y would not happen. This
is called a counterfactual theory of causation, and it is also flawed. Imagine a
man throws a brick at a window, and a second later you throw a brick at the
same window. If the man's brick hits the window first, his brick causes the
window to shatter. But even if he never threw a brick, the window would still
have shattered, because of your brick.
As you can see, it is very hard to say what causation is. This has led some
philosophers to deny that there are causes in the world at all.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. `Pre-established harmony" is the view that when God created the world, he
created things so that they would change their own states in such a way that it
would appear as though they were causally interacting. Gottfried Wilhelm
Leibniz is the most famous philosopher to endorse pre-established harmony.
2. "Occasionalists" disagree with Leibniz and claim that God is the only cause in
the world; things created by God don't even have the ability to influence
themselves. The laws of nature are just the laws God has freely chosen to obey
in changing the world. The most famous Occasionalist was Nicolas de
Malebranche (1638-1715).
SUNDAY, DAY 7
Five Pillars
The Five Pillars of Islam are the five rites that every Muslim must perform.
The first is Shahadah, or faith in God. The creed of Islam is that, "There is no
god but Allah and Muhammad is His prophet" This is the foundation of Islam,
and it is believed that the only true evil in the world is disagreement with this
statement.
The second Pillar is Salah, or daily prayer. Muslims are required to pray five
times per day: at sunrise, midday, midafternoon, sunset, and night. They must
ritually wash themselves first, including their hands, heads, feet, and ankles.
Then they pray while facing toward Mecca. Although praying can occur
anywhere, men often congregate in mosques to do so. Women, on the other
hand, are either barred from mosques or forced to use a segregated space. On
Fridays, men are required to gather at the mosque to hear the imam give a
sermon. The prayers are memorized and must be spoken in Arabic.
The third Pillar is Zakat, or alms giving. In exchange for a later reward, Muslims
are required to give a portion of their income to charity in order to further
strengthen the religion or help the poor. This typically is 2.5 percent of their
income, but some Muslims voluntarily give more to gain additional divine
praise.
The fourth Pillar is Siyyam [saum], or fasting. During Ramadan, the ninth month
of Islam's lunar calendar, Muslims are forbidden to eat, drink, smoke, or have
sex between sunrise and sunset. This was the month during which Muhammad
had his first revelation. During the month, Muslims pray and read the Quran
more often than usual.
The fifth and final Pillar is Hajj, or pilgrimage to Mecca. Each Muslim is
required to go to Mecca once in his or her lifetime. When Muslims make the
pilgrimage, they wear simple clothing, thereby eliminating any indication of
class or culture. This pilgrimage symbolizes Muhammad's return to Mecca after
defeating the city and destroying the idol temple Kaaba. Today, the Kaaba is the
center of the Hajj ceremony.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Muslims living in non-Muslim cultures often find these practices difficult to
comply with, especially the Salah, which requires stopping five times a day
(twice during the work day) to pray.
2. These requirements have the effect of constantly forcing Muslims to
reconfirm their faith through small practices. Not only does this remind them
of their commitment to God, but it also helps them to identify themselves as
Muslims.
3. There are some exemptions to these rules. For instance, people without proper
means do not have to participate in Zakat or the Hajj. And people who are sick,
young, elderly, or pregnant do not have to participate in the Siyyam.
MONDAY, DAY I
Commodore Matthew Perry and Japan
When Commodore Matthew Perry's (1794-1858) squadron of four warships
dropped anchor in Tokyo Bay in 1853, he found a mysterious land almost
beyond his comprehension. The Japan encountered by Perry's American
expedition had forcibly secluded itself from the outside world. While Europe and
the United States industrialized rapidly throughout the early nineteenth century,
Japan remained an island apart, for Westerners, an unexplored region of the
world. Ruled by a shogun and a feudal system of samurai warriors, the Japanese
allowed only limited contact with foreigners before Perry arrived.
President Millard Fillmore, eager to expand the reach of American commerce,
had dispatched Perry to Japan to intimidate the shogun into allowing trade with
the United States. Faced with the long guns of the American warships, the
shogun had little choice. The treaty was signed, and similar agreements with
other Western powers soon followed.
Despite the shogun's initial reluctance, Japan took on modernization with zeal.
Within fifty years, the medieval island had transformed itself into a major
industrial power. In an unprecedented leap forward, Japan caught up with and
eventually surpassed many major Western powers in military might and
economic firepower. By the early twentieth century, Japan was able to fight-and
win-a war against a major European power, the Russian empire.
Perry was a veteran of the War of 1812, and in his long naval career he battled
pirates and slave traders before completing the mission that made him famous.
His legacy remains controversial. Perry's expedition triggered a chain of events
that turned Japan into one of the most powerful and prosperous nations in the
world, but many Japanese resent the humiliating way the West forced Japan to
change its way of life.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Perry was from Newport, Rhode Island. Every year the city celebrates his
voyage with a Black Ships Festival, after the name the Japanese used to
describe the American ships.
2. The American flag from Perry's expedition was saved and flown over the USS
Missouri when japan surrendered aboard the battleship at the end of World War
II
3. Perry's older brother, Oliver Hazard Perry, was also a naval hero who
commanded a warship in the War of 1812 against the British. He is famous for
exclaiming after a victory, "We have met the enemy and they are ours."
TUESDAY, DAY 2
The Waste Land
T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land (1922) is the great nightmare landmark of
twentiethcentury poetry-a single work that encapsulates all the fear, alienation,
and disillusionment that arose in the West after World War I. Full of allusions to
Buddhist and Hindu myth, Ovid, the Bible, St. Augustine, Arthurian legend,
Dante, Shakespeare, and a host of other sources, it represents a fascinating
intersection of ancient belief and ritual with the existential crises of the modern
world.
Like many works of the modernist period, The Waste Land is largely a response
to World War I. The pointless loss of millions of lives left Europe reeling, as did
the awareness that much of this brutality had been wreaked by manmade
technology and machinery. To many, the world had suddenly become inhuman
and spiritually barren, with civilization seemingly collapsing in on itself.
In The Waste Land, Eliot asked how redemption and renewal can be found in a
landscape of such desolation. From its opening lines, the poem is filled with
images of drought and sterility, countered by attempts by both nature and
humankind to generate rebirth:
The poem's narration jumps abruptly between different voices, disorienting the
reader as if he or she has been dropped into a crowd of strangers or marooned in
an unfamiliar place. Though these ominous voices are often aimed directly at the
reader, the speakers' identities remain unknown:
The Waste Land draws heavily from Arthurian legend and its references to the
Fisher King, a once-powerful leader who has been wounded or disabled, leaving
his domain a barren wasteland. Only when the knight Perceval completes a
series of tasks can the Fisher King be healed and his kingdom regenerated. Eliot
spends much of The Waste Land trying to discern how the modern world can
find similar renewal. Ultimately, a glimmer of hope returns, seemingly at
random, but it is a fragile hope at best-one to which the poem's final speaker, like
all of humankind, can cling only with a sense of resignation.
WEDNESDAY, DAY 3
The Thinker
Auguste Rodin's monumental sculpture The Thinker (1880) is one of the best
known works of art in the world. It has become an icon of the genius-creator or
anyone lost in thought.
The figure was designed for the Gates of Hell, the portal commissioned by the
French government in 1880 for the new Musee des Arts Decoratifs. It was
supposed to represent Dante, the medieval Italian poet whose Divine Comedy
served as the source for the entire project.
The original sculpture was only twenty-seven inches tall. Rodin used a muscular
man of about forty for his model-his own age at the time he commenced the
Gates. The Thinker rests his chin on the back ofhis open right hand. His
shoulders have literally sunken beneath the weight of his thoughts. His body is
tense, as is evident from the fact that his feet are gripping the base. Since the
figure was destined for the exact center of the upper tier of the portals, he is
pitched forward, with his head, hands, and knees projecting beyond his feet.
In 1902, a much larger (seventy-nine-inch tall), free-standing version of the
sculpture was cast by Henri Lebosse under Rodin's supervision for the Louisiana
Purchase Exposition in Saint Louis, Missouri. Rodin, however, rejected the copy.
Another cast was exhibited to mixed reviews at the Salon of 1904. The
installation of the statue in a public site finally took place in April 1906. During
a political crisis several years later, the statue was adopted as a Socialist symbol.
It was consequently moved to the garden of the Musee Rodin in 1922 on the
pretext that it was an obstacle during public ceremonies. Today, many casts of
The Thinker can be seen all over the world, nearly all of them, like the original,
located out of doors.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. In creating The Thinker, Rodin clearly had Michelangelo in mind, especially
his Moses in S. Pietro in Vincoli (Rome) and Lorenzo de' Medici in S. Lorenzo
(Florence).
2. A cast of The Thinker wasp/aced on Rodin's tomb in Meudon.
THURSDAY, DAY 4
Friction
Friction is the force that opposes a moving object when the surface of the object
rubs against another. For example, when you roll a ball on the grass, it is friction
that causes the ball to slow down and stop.
According to Sir Issac Newton's first law of motion, an object in motion stays in
motion unless acted upon by an outside force. If you were to throw a ball in the
vacuum of space, the ball would keep moving forever because there is no
friction in a vacuum. But on earth, there is no such thing as a frictionless surface.
There is always something to get in the way. Even if you throw a ball into the
air, the air will rub against the ball, creating heat and slowing the ball down.
Friction is caused by very complex molecular interactions on the surface of
objects. In general, rough surfaces cause more friction-for example, sandpaper
on jagged wood. Smooth surfaces minimize friction, like a hockey puck gliding
across ice. But there are exceptions to this rule. If you make two metal surfaces
extremely flat and smooth, their surfaces will actually fuse together in what is
called a cold weld. In this case, the frictional resistance to motion is actually
quite great.
There are many types of friction, but on a daily basis, we regularly encounter
static friction and kinetic friction. Static friction is the friction of two objects that
are not moving in relation to each other, like when a couch is simply resting on
the ground. Kinetic friction is the friction of two objects that are in a relative
motion and rubbing against each other, for example someone pushing a couch
across the floor. In general, static friction is greater than kinetic friction. This
explains why when you are moving furniture, the initial shove always requires
more effort than continuing to push the object once it is in motion.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. When you rub your hands together, friction causes them to get warm.
2. Lubricants such as oil are substances that reduce the friction between surfaces.
The study of lubricants and friction is called tribology.
3. Brakes on cars and bicycles work by magnifying friction.
4. The treads on sneakers increase their friction on the pavement, making it
easier for you to push off the ground.
FRIDAY, DAY 5
Frederic Chopin
The collected works of Frederic Chopin (1810-1849) are required music for any
aspiring pianist. His compositions, which lacked the virtuosic bombast of his
contemporaries, had no shortage of subtlety, beauty, and taste. In short, Chopin
was the beloved composer for the salon, rather than the concert hall, and during
his lifetime, no one could surpass him in that role.
Born in 1810 to a French father and a Polish mother outside of Warsaw, Poland,
Chopin grew up around the boys of an aristocratic boarding school run by his
father. He adopted many of their attitudes, and as a young man gained a
reputation for being prim, snobbish, obsessed with style, and rather effeminate.
Chopin began composing short pieces called mazurkas and polonaises, both
based on Polish folk dances, when he was a teenager, and he became the toast of
Warsaw playing them in the drawing rooms of the aristocracy. In 1830, he left
Warsaw for Vienna and eventually Paris, where he would make his name.
In Paris, Chopin tried his hand at large public concerts, but his writing style-with
delicate, nuanced uses of volume, harmony, and dissonance-didn't go over well.
After 1835, he hardly ever performed outside of the salons of the rich and
sophisticated, who adored his playing style and his dandy poseur personality.
While in Paris, Chopin made friends with various artists and intellectuals,
including his nemesis Franz Liszt. Most important, he became involved in a
torrid love affair with the eccentric cross-dressing novelist George Sand. She
vacationed with Chopin in Majorca in 1838-1839. While there, Chopin became
ill with tuberculosis, but he had enough energy to write his twenty-four Preludes.
After they returned to Sand's French country house, Chopin's condition
worsened. Tired of her lover's neurotic and sickly ways, Sand left Chopin in
1846.
Chopin died in Paris in 1849, leaving behind one of the most important bodies of
piano literature of any composer.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. When Chopin left Warsaw, he took a silver urn full ofPolish soil. He would
never return to his homeland, but the urn was buried with him in a staunch
expression of nationalism.
2. Nationalism was a big theme in Chopin's career, and he expressed his love
ofhis homeland mostly through the music he wrote. His use ofPolish folk and
court dances, and in particular his Military Polonaise No. 3 in A Major, which
commemorates a failed Polish uprising against the Czar in 1831, demonstrates
his devotion to Poland.
3. Chopin wrote a cello concerto and a handful of short pieces for other
instruments, but everything else he wrote-dozens of nocturnes, scherzos,
ballades, preludes, mazurkas, polonaises, and etudes-was all for solo piano.
SATURDAY, DAY 6
Problem of Evil
Consider the following four claims:
God is all powerful. (Anything possible is within his power.)
God is all knowing.
God is perfectly good.
There is evil in the world.
Traditionally, theists-people who believe in God-have accepted these four
claims, but many philosophers have argued that they are incompatible. If God is
all powerful, he could have made a world without evil. And since a world
without evil is better than a world with evil, how could a perfectly benevolent
God knowingly create a world in which there is evil?
One solution is to deny that God bears responsibility for the evil in the world.
Supporters of this view argue God created the world, but mankind created the
evil. Mankind has free will, and the only way God could have prevented evil is
by not giving us free will. But, the argument goes, a world in which we do not
have free will would be even worse than the actual world. Therefore, God made
the best possible choice: He created mankind with free will, which led to there
being evil.
Of course, this theory does not resolve the problem of natural evil-hurricanes,
earthquakes, and tsunamis that cause death and suffering. God could have
created a natural world with fewer disasters that kill innocent people. So why
didn't he?
Gottfried Willhelm Leibniz (1646-1716) responded to this question by famously
claiming that this is the best of all possible worlds. Admittedly, there are features
of this world that are bad. For instance, the existence of deadly hurricanes.
However, argued Leibniz, a world without deadly hurricanes would be worse
than this world. For instance, it would lack the elegant natural laws that govern
the behavior of weather.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. The problem ofreconciling God's perfect goodness with the evil in the world is
called theodicy.
2. Some philosophers believe that there is no best possible world for God to
choose and that he chooses among various lesser alternatives. They argue that
ifGod must choose the best world, this conflicts with his freedom of choice.
Sharia
In Islam, Sharia, or the law, is of fundamental importance, inextricably
connected to the practice of the faith.
The scholar Seyyed Hossein Nasr proposes the following analogy. Imagine a
great circle. The entire circumference of the circle is the Sharia. It is at the
circumference that each Muslim must begin his or her journey along the radius
of the circle-which is Tarigat, or the Path to the center of the circle-which is
Haqiqa, or the Truth. Although a Muslim may still be considered a Muslim
without obeying the Sharia, he or she cannot achieve Haqiqa without beginning
there.
There are no realms of society that fall outside Sharia. It can be divided into two
areas: ibadat, or the law pertaining to worship, and muamalat, the law pertaining
to transactions. Muamalat covers all social, political, and economic
relationships.
The five categories of rules in Sharia are:
REQUIRED: e.g., daily prayers
SUGGESTED: e.g., charity
INDIFFERENT: e.g., the vegetables in one's diet
REPREHENSIBLE: e.g., divorce
FORBIDDEN: e.g., murder, eating pork, and consuming alcohol
As time passed, various legal scholars diverged from each other, and within
Sunni Islam four individual schools of thought emerged. Still, for the most part,
and for all of the basic rites of Islam, all five schools-four Sunni, one Shiite-
agree.
An important distinction between Shiites and Sunnis revolves around the
concept of ijtihad, or the basic sources of Sharia. Sunnis believe that since the
tenth century, the ijtihad texts have been closed to reinterpretation. Shiites,
however, believe it is their duty to periodically reinvestigate the ijtihad to see if
any laws should be adapted to modernity.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Sharia is believed to be God's immutable law, and while Shiites believe in
interpretation, they are careful not to create new laws.
2. Muslims are not allowed to eat pork or any meat that wasn't killed in the name
of God. They are also forbidden to eat monkeys, dogs, cats, and most
carnivores.
MONDAY, DAY I
John Brown
John Brown (1800-1859) was a militant antislavery activist executed in 1859 by
the state of Virginia for attempting to spark a slave rebellion. In military terms,
Brown was a complete failure, but as a social movement his uprising illustrated
the commitment of abolitionists to end slavery. With a handful of followers
Brown seized a federal armory in Harper's Ferry, Virginia, in the naive belief that
slaves in the area would flee their masters and join him. The revolt never
materialized, and he was captured within days and hanged shortly thereafter.
Brown belonged to the violent fringe of the abolitionist movement, which had
grown steadily since the early 1800s. By 1859, most Northerners opposed
slavery, but few embraced Brown's extreme tactics. Many moderate Northerners,
including Abraham Lincoln, hoped to end the spread of slavery but stopped short
of demanding immediate abolition. Radicals like Brown and William Lloyd
Garrison, a leading abolitionist writer from Boston, wanted immediate abolition
of what they saw as an unacceptable moral evil. Garrison, attacking the
moderates, sarcastically suggested they "tell a man whose house is on fire to give
a moderate alarm."
Southerners, meanwhile, regarded both camps of abolitionists as Northern liberal
busybodies. Slavery, according to many Southerners, was ordained by the Bible
and, moreover, crucial to the agrarian economy of the South. John C. Calhoun,
an eminent South Carolina politician who served in the Senate and as vice
president, called slavery not evil at all but "a positive good." In the South, the
news of Brown's raid provoked widespread panic and disbelief. Brown's revolt
failed militarily, but politically he was successful. Terrified, many Southerners
concluded that separating from the North was the only way to preserve slavery.
When Abraham Lincoln won the 1860 election with the support of Northern
abolitionists, the Southern states seceded, sparking the Civil War that eventually
did end slavery.
Brown's antislavery crusade remains controversial to this day. By the modern
definition, Brown was unquestionably a terrorist. In a skirmish in Kansas a few
years before Harper's Ferry, Brown and his sons used broadswords to hack a
family that supported slavery to death. Yet Brown's terrorism aided what nearly
everyone today regards as a just cause.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Brown was raised in Connecticut and Ohio by a strict Christian father, and he
explicitly based his opposition to slavery on religion. On the gallows in
Virginia, Brown said, "I, John Brown, am now quite certain that the crimes of
thisguilty land will never be purged away but with blood. I had, as I now think,
vainly flattered myself that without very much bloodshed it might be done. "
2. During the Civil War, Union soldiers sang a marching song called `John
Brown's Body."A Boston abolitionist, Julia Ward Howe, heard the song and
composed new lyrics. Her song, The Battle Hymn of the Republic, "remains
one ofAmerica's most belovedpatriotic songs.
TUESDAY, DAY 2
Marcel Proust
French novelist Marcel Proust (1871-1922) is remembered almost entirely for
just one work, but that one work has been enough to cement his reputation. His
mammoth novel A la Recherche du Temps Perdu-translated into English as
either In Search of Lost Time or Remembrance of Things Past-remains one of
the great literary works of the twentieth century.
Proust benefited from a wealthy upbringing in Paris and received a thorough
education in both literature and law. He moved in heady social circles from a
young age, active in the belle epoque salons of the Parisian elite. After
publishing his first short story collection in 1896, Proust worked on an
autobiographical novel, Jean Santeuil, that would serve as the foundation for his
later masterpiece.
Amid deteriorating health and lingering grief over the death of his parents,
Proust began work on A la Recherche in 1909. The novel is truly gigantic, more
than 3,000 pages long and featuring a cast of more than 2,000 characters.
Published in seven volumes from 1913 to 1927, it was unlike any novel the
world had ever seen; indeed, several publishers rejected its first installments,
unsure what to make of it.
A la Recherche is essentially autobiographical, following the development of a
young man as he searches for what has made him who he is, recaptures and
relives memories from his youth, and ultimately prepares to write a novel. It is as
much a philosophical and psychological work as a literary one: Along the way,
the narrator muses on love, identity, sexual ambiguity, aesthetics, art, and other
topics. Although most people see the narrator as a stand-in for Proust, he leaves
the question of whether the reader should indeed view the author and narrator as
one and the same ambiguous.
As its title indicates, the novel is deeply concerned with time and memory.
Proust conceives of time as a flowing, amorphous whole rather than an ordered,
linear progression of moments. Often, previously lost memories come rushing
back to the narrator as the result of some sensory cue. In one famous passage,
the narrator vividly remembers experiences from his childhood upon tasting a
madeleine, which he used to eat dipped in tea. This experimentation lived on
long after Proust's death, as countless other modernist authors built on his
explorations of memory and time in their own landmark works.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Proust published the first volume ofA la Recherche at his own expense, using
money he inherited from his parents.
2. During the infamous Dreyfus affair of 1897-1899, Proust spent considerable
time and money organizing petitions on behalf of French Jewish army officer
Alfred Dreyfus, who had been unjustly imprisoned for treason.
WEDNESDAY, DAY 3
Claude Monet
Claude Monet (1840-1926) was one of the central figures of the impressionist
movement. He is known for his many paintings of water lilies in his garden at
Giverny, France.
Born in Paris, Monet moved at the age of five to Le Havre on the Normandy
Coast. His early exposure to nature and the sea profoundly influenced his artistic
career. Monet soon acquired something of a local reputation for caricature,
attracting the attention of the plein-air landscape painter, Eugene Bodin. In 1862,
after two years of military service in Algeria, Monet received parental
permission to pursue a career as a painter and moved to Paris. There he studied
in the studio of Charles Gleyre, where he met future impressionists Auguste
Renoir and Alfred Sisley, as well as the Dutch landscape painter Johann
Barthold.
In 1865, 1866, and 1868, Monet exhibited works at the official Salon. By the
late 1860s, however, he was exploring new techniques that would eventually
lead to impressionism. In 1869, for example, he and Renoir painted together at
La Grenouillere, a popular boating spot. As they worked side by side, both
artists used fragmented brushwork to capture the ephemeral quality of light and
color in the reflection of the water.
In 1870, Monet married his mistress Camille Doncieux and moved to London in
order to escape the Franco-Prussian War. During the nine months he spent there,
he made numerous paintings of the River Thames and met his future dealer, Paul
Durand-Ruel. In 1872, Monet returned to Argenteuil, near Paris, where he lived
for the next six years. Two years later, he was a major force behind the first
impressionist show, to which he submitted the painting Impression: Sunrise that
gave the movement its name.
In 1883, Monet moved to Giverny, northwest of Paris, where he designed his
own gardens, made famous by the many paintings he did of them in the last
twenty-five years of his life.
Monet continued to travel extensively from Givernyto London, Venice, and
Rouen. In the 1890s Monet began working on several series of paintings that
depicted an identical subjecta haystack, a cathedral, a view of poplars-as it
appeared at different times of day. While engaged in a series, Monet would work
on up to eight paintings at a time, devoting less than one hour to each.
In the years since his death, Monet's influence and popularity have increased
enormously. In 2004, one of his paintings of the Parliament Houses in London
sold for more than $20 million. Thousands of tourists flock annually to his house
and gardens at Giverny. Monet's works hang in major museums throughout the
world, most notably at the Orangerie and the Musee Marmottan in Paris.
ADDITIONAL FACT
1. Monet once noted that he wished he had been born blind, then suddenly gotten
sight so that he could see without preconceived notions.
THURSDAY, DAY 4
The Sun and Nuclear Fusion
The sun does not burn the way that wood burns in a fire. Instead, it acts like a
giant nuclear reactor. The energy from the sun comes from nuclear fusion-the
process of combining two small atomic nuclei into one larger nucleus. The sun
mostly fuses hydrogen atoms into helium atoms to create energy. It also fuses
helium into beryllium, and beryllium into lithium.
Because of the sun's immense mass and gravity, the core of the sun is an
environment of intense pressure and heat. These qualities are what allow fusion
to take place. Under normal circumstances, the protons in the nucleus of
hydrogen atoms repel each other because they are all positively charged. But the
pressure at the center of the sun squeezes them together, overcoming the
electromagnetic force. When the two hydrogen atoms combine into helium, a
tiny amount of the hydrogen atoms' mass is converted into a large amount of
energy. The conversion follows Einstein's famous formula E=mc2. The energy
released is equal to the mass lost times the speed of light squared. Because
fusion generates such fantastic amounts of energy from such small quantities of
fuel, scientists have been trying for decades to create controlled nuclear fusion
reactions on earth. But cold fusion still remains more science fiction than fact.
Over the past 4.5 billion years, the sun has used up about half of its hydrogen
supply. When it runs out of hydrogen, the sun's core will contract due to gravity,
heating up and expanding its outer layers. The sun will grow into a red giant,
enveloping and vaporizing the earth.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. The sun converts about 600 million tons ofhydrogen nuclei into helium each
second.
2. In the process, the sun loses roughly four million tons of its mass, which is all
converted into energy.
3. Energy from the sun is carried to earth in the form ofphotons. Each photon
must interact with many gas molecules on its way from the sun's core to its
surface. This takes approximately 100,000 to 200,000 years.
4. It takes about eight minutes for d photon to reach earth from the surface of the
sun.
FRIDAY, DAY 5
Romantic-Era Virtuosos: Frantz Liszt and Niccol
Paganini
The romantic sense of excess, decadence, and genius-worship is illustrated
vividly in the careers of two early-romantic virtuosos, Niccol Paganini
(17821840) and Franz Liszt (1811-1886).
Paganini, a gaunt-looking Italian master violinist, was so good at playing the
violinparticularly long, complicated technical passages-that he was often
accused of having made a pact with the devil in return for his marvelous skills.
Paganini's fame began at a Paris recital in 1828, where he charmed the women in
the audience and wowed the critics. However, Paganini died in Nice without,
however, leaving a repertoire of great compositions. Like other virtuosos, most
of his work was meant to showcase his skills with breakneck-paced fast solo
sections and minimal, if any, accompaniment. He wrote six violin concertos,
only two of which are regularly played.
When Franz Liszt, a tremendously talented Hungarian pianist, got to Paris in
1824, he was so impressed with Paganini's playing that he vowed to become
"the Paganini of the piano," locking himself up for two years to practice his
technique. When Liszt finally achieved his goal and began performing, it
became clear he was a born showman. He would often fake hysterical fits at the
end of his performances to heighten the notion that he was completely lost in
the transcendental experience of the music. Liszt's act worked on the ladies.
Liszt had many lovers among the swooning upper-crust of Paris, including the
Countess Marie d'Agoult and the Russian princess Caroline de Sayn-
Wittgenstein, whom he later married, and who converted him to quiet Catholic
piety.
These two composers and soloists, more than anything, shifted the focus of
romantic music to performance, rather than composition, and in doing so pulled
it further away from the classical aesthetic than ever.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Paganini's most famous trick was to play so furiously that he broke three ofhis
strings, but still continued playing using only one.
2. When Paganini was a boy, he mutilated his hands to increase the reach ofhis
fingers.
3. Later in life, Liszt confessed his philandering sins to the pope himself, who
cut the composer off ha4rway through his confession and said, "Enough, Liszt.
Tell your sins to your piano."
SATURDAY, DAY 6
Freedom of the Will
In order to be morally responsible for some action, you must take that action
freely. For example, if you see someone drowning in a lake, but you are tied to a
stake in the ground and cannot free yourself, then you are not morally to blame
for not rescuing the drowning swimmer. Likewise, if you are somehow
brainwashed and ordered to commit a crime, you are arguably not responsible
for committing the crime, because your freedom was impaired.
According to some scientific theories, the world is deterministic. Given the way
the world has been in the past and the physical laws that govern it, there is only
one way the future can be. Consider that this applies to your actions as well. At
the moment just before you perform some action, given the way the world has
been in the past and given the physical laws of the universe, there is only one
possible outcome. Right now it is physically determined what you will do at
every moment in the future.
Does determinism of this sort erase moral responsibility? If you commit some
morally bad action, could you plead that the physical laws and past history of the
universe were so configured that there was no alternative?
Ifyou believe that free will and determinism are incompatible, you must deny
determinism or deny moral responsibility. If you deny determinism, you have to
believe that there is genuine causal indeterminism in the world, introduced by
free agents like us; the future history of the world is left indeterminate by the
natural laws, and we determine it through our actions. If you deny moral
responsibility, you must hold that the world is deterministic and that therefore we
lack free will.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Philosophers who think that free will and determinism are compatible are
called compatibilists. Philosophers who deny it are called incompatibilists.
2. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz was a famous compatibilist,; he believed that all of
our actions are causally determined, but that we are nevertheless free.
SUNDAY, DAY 7
Shiites and Sunnis
The major split in Islam, between Shiite Islam and Sunni Islam occurred in the
wake of Muhammad's death. When Islam's prophet passed away at the age of
sixty-three in 632 CE, he left no clear successor. The dispute over who-Ali or
Abu Bakr-should take Muhammad's place, led to the split.
Shiites claim that Muhammad gave a speech at Ghadir al-Khumm in which he
frequently referenced and praised Ali, his cousin and son-in-law. They interpret
Muhammad's praise as calling for Ali to lead all of Islam. Thus, Shiites believe
that Ali was the first leader, or imam of Islam. Shiites believe that they alone
have remained faithful to Muhammad's initial teachings and that the Sunnis have
strayed. They also claim that all future imams must be descendents of
Muhammad, through his son Ali and Ali's wife, Fatima.
Sunnis, on the other hand, claim that while Muhammad did speak and praise Ali
at Gadir Khorn, this did not mean that Ali was to become Islam's next leader.
Instead, after some infighting, they believe that Abu Bakr emerged as the first
caliph. Abu Bakr was a close confidant of Muhammad, as well as Muhammad's
father-in-law. When Muhammad initially fled Mecca for Medina, Abu Bakr was
his only companion. Additionally, when Muhammad was absent, Abu Bakr
sometimes led prayers, which lead Sunnis to believe he was favored as a
successor by Muhammad.
As the two sects have grown apart over the centuries, the schism between them
has widened. Although the split essentially began as a political issue between
two groups with one belief system, this is no longer the case. Having been
separated for so long, their sets of beliefs, laws, and practices have also changed
in various ways. A major source of these differences arises from Hadith, or oral
traditions that record and narrate the teachings of the prophet and his
companions. Shiites accept only Hadith as authentic when it can be traced back
to Muhammad and Ali, and not those which arise from other sources. Thus,
Shiites disregard many traditions that Sunnis treasure as sacred.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Although Sunnis do not believe that Ali was the first caliph, they do believe
he was the fourth of the Four Righteously Guided Caliphs, succeedingAbu
Bakr, Urnar, and Uthrnan.
2. Today, Sunni Islam is the largest sect, comprising nearly 90 percent of Islam,
with Shiite making up the second largest sect at about 9 percent. However,
these statistics are suspect because Shiites are oppressed in many areas, and it
is not believed that these numbers fully reflect their total population.
3. The Hajj, or holy pilgrimage to Mecca, is one ofthe few events that cause the
normally separate populations ofSunnis and Shiites to congregate together.
During the Hajj, however, all Muslims wear the plain clothing ofa pilgrim, thus
hiding ethnic and social differences.
MONDAY, DAY I
Abraham Lincoln
Acclaimed as the greatest president in American history, Abraham Lincoln
(1809-1865) lead the nation through the Civil War that preserved the Union and
resulted in the end of slavery. Born in Kentucky, Lincoln was elected to the
White House from Illinois in 1860. He was tragically assassinated at a theater by
a crazed Southern sympathizer in 1865, only a few days after the Confederate
Army under General Robert E. Lee surrendered at Appomattox Courthouse.
Under Lincoln's leadership, the United States won the war, but Lincoln did not
live to see the peace.
Lincoln was a gangly, unattractive man with a penchant for melancholy. Modern
scholarship has suggested that he may have suffered from depression. Before
becoming president, Lincoln's political experience amounted to a few local
offices, one term in Congress in 1847-49, and a failed run for the Senate in 1855.
But despite his less than auspicious start, Lincoln turned out to be one of the
most determined and certainly the most eloquent men ever to win the presidency.
Lincoln believed preserving the Union was necessary at all costs. Without the
United States, Lincoln felt, the republican ideals it embodied would "perish from
the earth." Long before the days of presidential speechwriters, Lincoln crafted
moving speeches that convinced Americans to endure the hardships of the war.
He was reelected to the White House in 1864 against a candidate who promised
to end the war, a victory that reflected Lincoln's ability to keep Americans united
around the cause of the Union despite terrible losses.
Lincoln had little military experience himself, but he did not hesitate to overrule
his generals. Only with General Ulysses S. Grant did Lincoln find a leader he
trusted to lead the Union effort, despite rumors that Grant was an alcoholic. "Tell
me the brand of whiskey that Grant drinks," Lincoln reportedly quipped. "I
would like to send a barrel of it to my other generals."
Before Lincoln's death, he planned to let the Southern states rejoin the Union on
generous terms, without punishing the leaders of the rebellion. His assassination
left President Andrew Johnson in charge. Lincoln "would have proven the best
friend the South could have had," Grant wrote. "I knew his goodness of heart, his
generosity, his yielding disposition, his desire to have everybody happy, and
above all his desire to see all the people of the United States enter again upon the
full privileges of citizenship with equality among all."
ADDITIONAL FACT
1. Lincoln's assassin was john Wilkes Booth, a well-known Shakespearean actor
and a distant relative of current British prime minister Tony Blair. After the
shooting, Booth fled to Maryland, where he was cornered by Union soldiers
and killed after refusing to surrender.
TUESDAY, DAY 2
Invisible Man
One of the rarest birds in literature is the novel that manages to combine
penetrating social criticism with groundbreaking literary technique. Ralph
Ellison's Invisible Man (1952) delivers on both counts. It is an unsettling
investigation of twentieth-century African-American life and also an innovative
melding of the English language and the rhythms of jazz music. It accomplished
the uncommon feat of shocking white and black readers equally: Whites were
shaken by the narrator's anger, while blacks were stung by Ellison's readiness to
criticize blacks as much as he had whites. Not surprisingly, Invisible Man
became a controversial bestseller and won the National Book Award.
Born in Oklahoma in 1914, Ellison aspired to become a jazz musician, attending
the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama for formal training. After leaving college,
though, he took a job with the Federal Writers' Project, a Great Depression-era
government literary initiative. He moved to New York City in 1936, becoming
friends with the poet Langston Hughes, novelist Richard Wright, and other black
luminaries.
The nameless protagonist of Invisible Man is a gifted black student from the
South. After enduring public humiliation from a local white group in order to
receive a college scholarship, he finds that the black president of the college is
just as insidious and scheming as any overtly racist white man. The narrator
leaves for Harlem, where he becomes involved in a political organization that
prizes his abilities as an orator. But this experience likewise ends in
disillusionment, as the narrator comes under attack from both blacks and whites
in the group who resent his influence and see him as a threat to their own power.
Though stinging in its depiction of white racism, Invisible Man is just as brazen
in its criticism of the African-American community. The narrator encounters
countless examples of selfinterested blacks who backstab and undermine one
another, concerned more with politicking than with the civil rights cause.
Ultimately, the narrator realizes that he is "invisible": Everyone he meets,
blinded by either racism or self-interest, sees him as either a negative stereotype
or a tool to meet their own ends. Frustrated by this denial of his individuality, the
narrator retreats underground, where he writes his life story-the only thing he can
do to make his voice heard.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Invisible Man was the only novel Ellison wrote. The other works he published
were the essay collections Shadow and Act (1964) and Going to the Territory
(1986).
2. Several characters in Invisible Man are modeled on real black political
leaders, including Booker Ti Washington and Marcus Garvey.
WEDNESDAY, DAY 3
Auguste Renoir
One of the most important painters of the impressionist movement, Auguste
Renoir (1841-1919) is most famous for his scenes of leisure and his sensual
portraits of women and children.
Renoir, the son of a tailor, began his artistic career at the age of thirteen when he
took a job decorating fans and painting flowers on porcelain. He improved his
skills by making copies at the Louvre Museum and then, in 1861, enrolled in the
Ecole des Beaux-Arts. One year later, Renoir entered the studio of the Swiss
academic painter, Charles Gleyre, where he met future impressionists Claude
Monet, Alfred Sisley, and Frederic Bazille. Although Renoir contributed several
works to the official Salon in the 1860s, he joined the impressionists in their first
rebellious exhibition of 1874.
In the following decade, the principles of impressionism had a profound impact
on Renoir's style. In Le Moulin de la Galette (1876), the composition is
arbitrarily cut off, making the painting appear to be a continuation of the world
outside it.
Renoir submitted Le Moulin de la Galette to the third impressionist exhibition in
1877. By 1878, he had returned to the official Salon, where he began cultivating
the patronage of fashionable and wealthy individuals. Freed of financial
restraints, Renoir began to travel extensively-to Northern Africa in 1881 and to
Italy for an extended period beginning in 1882. In Italy, Renoir studied the
classicism of Raphael and ancient sculpture, an endeavor that made him question
the subjective values of impressionism. Beginning in 1883, Renoir's earlier
interest in transient color, changeable light, and loose brushstroke was replaced
by a growing concern for volume, form, and contour.
In 1900, Renoir received the Legion d'Honneur, evidence of his distinguished
reputation in official circles. Soon afterward, his health began to decline.
Following an attack of rheumatoid arthritis in 1894, Renoir gradually lost control
of his limbs. By 1910 he could paint only by binding his brush to his hand. To
make matters worse, he was plagued by family problems. In 1915, his son Jean,
who later became a famous filmmaker, was seriously wounded in World War I.
Soon afterward, Renoir's wife died after visiting her son in the hospital. Renoir
continued working despite his hardships. At the age of seventy, he began to
experiment with sculpture, instructing his assistant, Richard Guino, to cast the
figures that he conceived.
Renoir's intentions as an artist were best summarized by his own words: "The
earth as the paradise of the gods: That is what I want to paint."
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. In Italy, Renoir discovered and was deeply influenced by the The Treatise on
Painting by Cennino Cennini a fifteenth century Florentine artist.
2. Georges Charpentier, a fashionable book publisher, introduced Renoir to
wealthy socialites from whom he received many commissions for portraits.
THURSDAY, DAY 4
Rainbows
Rainbows are the result of sunlight bending through raindrops. This bending,
called refraction, occurs when light passes through the water in the air.
Water droplets refract light, dispersing it into its component colors, which travel
at different frequencies. Although you may have been taught that there are seven
colors of the rainbowred, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet-there are
actually as many colors as there are raindrops reflecting light in the sky. The
rainbow possesses a full spectrum of colors, each observed at a different angle.
Primary rainbows occur between 40 and 42 degrees above the horizon, with the
center of the arch directly opposite the sun. At sunset, the angle of sunlight
allows an observer on the ground to see a full semicircle, whereas at noon, it is
impossible to see a rainbow because the sun is directly overhead. From an
airplane, it is possible to see a full circle of a rainbow because there are
raindrops above and below the observer.
Secondary rainbows, or double rainbows, occur when light is reflected inside a
rainbow twice. The second rainbow is fainter, and because of the double
reflection, the colors appear in the reverse order. Secondary rainbows appear
about 10 degrees higher in the sky than primary rainbows.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Third and fourth order rainbows have been observed, and thirteenth order
rainbows exist in theory.
2. Moonlight is sometimes bright enough to create a rainbow. Lunar rainbows
usually appear as a faint white arc.
3. It is physically impossible to walk under a rainbow. They literally exist only in
the eyes of the observer.
4. In Greek mythology, Iris, goddess of the rainbow, sent messages from heaven
to earth.
FRIDAY, DAY 5
Johannes Brahms
One of the last great symphonic masters to work within the conventions of
traditional form, Johannes Brahms (1833-1897) was part classicist and part
romantic. He was a master of the symphonic language of the nineteenth century,
but he also tipped his hat to the masters of old. Brahms's music was suited to his
personality-sensitive, conservative, but by no means dry-and his death would
mark the death of the romantic era.
Born to a poor family in Hamburg, Germany, Brahms was taught piano at an
early age, and when he was twenty, embarked on a European tour with Eduard
Remeny, a fine young Hungarian violinist. While traveling Brahms met Franz
Liszt and Richard Wagner, but his greatest friend and the longtime champion of
his music was Robert Schumann. The older composer wrote articles promoting
Brahms as a genius in the pages of his New Journal of Music, and Brahms
became almost a part of the dysfunctional Schumann family. During the last two
years of Schumann's life, when his madness was grating on his wife, Clara,
Brahms comforted her, and eventually fell madly in love. However, his love was
reportedly never consummated.
Brahms was an itinerant conductor and soloist, traveling constantly between
European capitals. He wrote his Piano Concerto No. 1 in D Minor (1859) for the
Schumanns, dedicating its second movement to Clara and evoking Robert's first
failed suicide attempt-jumping into the Rhine-in the first. He wrote his first,
hugely successful symphony in 1876 and by 1888 had written three more.
Brahms's symphonies, as well as his Hungarian dances and other pieces of
absolute-as in, nonprogrammatic, or appealing in only musical terms-orchestral
music, are what made him famous. Brahms was a devoted student of Bach's and
Palestrina's counterpoint and classical symphonic form, but he never lost his flair
for writing lush, romantic-style melodies.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. As a young man, Brahms played piano in Hamburg's seaside brothels, where
he developed a lifelong affection for prostitutes.
2. Clara Schumann, to whom Brahms once wrote, I love you more than anything
on earth," was Brahms's most trusted critic. He even changed the key ofhis
Piano Quartet in C-sharp Minor to C-minor at her suggestion.
3. Brahms lost favor with Liszt by falling asleep at one ofhis concerts.
SATURDAY, DAY 6
Immanuel Kant
"Two things fill the mind with ever-increasing wonder and awe, the more often
and the more intensely the mind of thought is drawn to them: the starry heavens
above me and the moral law within me."
-Critique of Practical Reason
Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) was born in Konigsberg, at that time a part of
Prussia. He lived his entire life there, never venturing far from the city of his
birth. The son of a harness-maker, he rose to become a professor at the
University of Konigsberg and was eventually recognized as the greatest
philosopher in Germany.
By mid-life, Kant had not accomplished anything of note. Then, at the
relatively advanced age of fifty-seven, he published his single most famous
work, the Critique of Pure Reason (1781). In the first critique, as it is known,
Kant argued that metaphysics can only be scientific if it describes not the way
the world is in itself, but how we experience the world. How the world is in
itself, he argued, we can never know. Space and time, for example, are not
objective features of the world as it is in itself, but forms of our experience.
In the Critique of Practical Reason (1788), or second Critique, Kant argued that
there is a universal moral law that applies to everyone and tells us what we ought
to do, regardless of what we want. This law reveals to us that we have free will,
and it gives us reason to believe that there is a benevolent God, and that there is
an afterlife. Of course, the first critique had demonstrated we can never know
that we are free, that there is a God, or that there is an afterlife. Thus, in Kant's
words, "I had to suspend knowledge, in order to make room for faith."
Kant's other works include the Critique of Judgment (1790) and a number of
smaller works and essays on moral and political philosophy, religion,
aesthetics, history, and natural science. The "critical" system, as he called it,
aims to rationally justify natural science, morality, and religion, while putting
limits on what human beings can truly be sure of.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Although Kant is best known as a philosopher, he lectured on almost every
topic pedagogy, logic, mathematics, natural science, and geography-and
published several significant works in physics and natural science.
2. Allegedly, Kants habits were so orderly that the citizens ofKonigsberg could
set their watches by his walks.
SUNDAY, DAY 7
Sufism
Sufism was a reaction against traditional Islam's heavy emphasis on the words of
the Quran. Instead, people who would later be known as Sufi, called for devotion
to the spirit of the Holy Book.
Sufis believe that there are two parts of Islam. One is external, such as doing
good deeds. The other is internal. Surfis believe that Islam is, at its core, a
personal faith. Emphasis is placed on having good intentions, rather than simply
good behavior.
The ideal Sufi was Muhammad, who lived a pious and virtuous life. While all
Sufis attempt to emulate Muhammad as much as possible, some believe their
goal is even higher-to reach the same state of inner peace that allowed
Muhammad to receive God's revelations.
The first Sufi orders began after Muhammad's death, when leaders began to tell
stories of his life and his everyday interaction with family and friends. These
stories inspired others, and the people who told them created a following.
Many of these orders practiced ritual chanting of the Quran, which is still seen
today. Others, such as the whirling dervishes, practiced a devotional spinning.
Each of these orders is led by a spiritual master, or shaykh. Their varied practices
represent the many paths to God, but all orders have a similar goal: to love God
without external motivation.
Sufis tell the story of Rabia, an eighth century female slave whose devotion was
so strong it inspired her owners to free her. She is said to have told God that if
she loves God because she fears hell, then she should burn in hell, and if she
loves God because she desires to reach heaven, then she should be denied
heaven. Sufis seek a pure communion with the divine.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. The word Sufi, comes from Suf meaning wool, signifying the simple wool
clothes that many Sufis chose to wear.
2. Some Sufis believed thatjesus Christ was an excellent example ofa Sufi
because he preached the gospel oflove.
3. Sufism often clashed with religious authorities because it deemphasized the
text of the Quran as well as many of those who held power. One example ofa
clash between Sufis and non-Sufis is the story of Hasan al-Hallaj who
proclaimed `Jam the truth,"orperhaps more correctly, "Jsee the truth."
Unfortunately, the word for truth is also a name for God. Hasan al-Hallaj was
believed to have said, `Jam God,"and he was executed for this alleged
blasphemy.
4. A bd al-Qadir al- Gilani, a founder ofone ofthe largest Sufi orders, was a child
in a caravan that was being robbed. The thieves demanded money from all who
were present, but ignored the small boy. However, his mother had sewn money
into his shirt. He called out to thieves to tell them that there was more money,
and, being awed by his honesty, the thieves converted to Islam on the spot.
MONDAY, DAY I
Appomattox Court HouseUlysses S. Grant and Robert E.
Lee
On the afternoon of April 9, 1865, the commander of the United States Army,
Ulysses S. Grant, rode his horse, Cincinnati, to a small farmhouse in the Virginia
town of Appomattox Court House. Waiting for him inside, was his rival Robert
E. Lee, the commander ofthe Confederate forces. After fouryears offighting, Lee
had concluded that his battered army was finished. Surrounded on all sides by
the Northerners, the Confederates were trapped. After a courteous handshake,
Lee signed an agreement surrendering his rebel army. The war was over.
The Civil War, which erupted in 1861, remains the bloodiest conflict in
American history. More than 550,000 soldiers were killed, and hundreds of
thousands more wounded. Lee and Grant, the two generals who led the rival
armies, came to personify the great heroism and tragedy on both sides of the
war.
Grant, the son of a tanner, was born in Ohio and graduated near the bottom of his
class at the American military academy at West Point. Before the Civil War
propelled Grant to greatness, even his father considered him a disappointment.
He left the army after fighting in the Mexican War and failed at a number of
business ventures before returning to work for his father's leather shop in the
1850s. The outbreak of hostilities gave Grant the chance to return to the only
thing he was ever good at: war. An alcoholic, Grant's steadfast devotion to
victory at any cost won him the confidence of Abraham Lincoln, who put him in
charge of all Union forces in 1864.
Lee, in contrast, came from a wealthy and respected Virginia family. He
graduated second in his class at West Point, where he was famously never given
a demerit for discipline. Lee obeyed the code of honor that many men in the
South professed but few actually lived. He had a successful career in the army
and served with Grant in the Mexican War. Lee opposed Southern secession, but
when his home state of Virginia left the Union, he felt honor-bound to serve the
new Confederacy.
Recalling that fateful afternoon at Appomattox, Grant later wrote in his
memoirs: "I felt like anything rather than rejoicing at the downfall of a foe who
had fought so long and valiantly, and had suffered so much for a cause, though
that cause was, I believe, one of the worst for which a people ever fought."
ADDITIONAL FACT
1. An extremely popular figure in the North, Grant was elected president of the
United States in 1868, but historians judge him as one of the country's worst
presidents.
TUESDAY, DAY 2
"Howl"
America tends to look back on the 1950s nostalgically, whitewashing the whole
decade as a utopia of postwar prosperity and Leave It to Beaver living. But even
during this seemingly tranquil time, an undercurrent of rebellion and
dissatisfaction existed in the United States. In literature, this rebelliousness
coalesced into the Beat generation, one of the figureheads of which was Allen
Ginsberg (1926-1997). Ginsberg's poem "Howl," a ranting but moving attack on
the American status quo, is one of the most concentrated expressions of the Beat
sensibility.
Ginsberg was a true New Yorker to the core: Born and raised in northern New
Jersey, he attended Columbia University and lived in Manhattan for most of his
life. At Columbia, he became fast friends with Jack Kerouac and William S.
Burroughs, who would themselves become major authors of the Beat
generation. After college, Ginsberg traveled extensively, blending his Jewish
roots with Zen Buddhism, leftist politics, jazz music, and rather alarming drug
habits.
"Howl" (1956), Ginsberg's first significant published work, is a lengthy, raving,
nakedly emotional diatribe that upends the seemingly picture-perfect American
social landscape of the 1950s:
I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving
hysterical naked, dragging themselves through the negro streets at
dawn lookingfor an angry fix,
angelheaded hipsters burningfor the ancient heavenly connection to the
starry dynamo in the machinery of night,
who poverty and tatters and hollow-eyed and high sat up smoking in the
supernatural darkness of cold-water flats floating across the tops of
cities contemplating jazz,
who bared their brains to Heaven under the El and saw Mohammedan
angels staggering on tenement roofs illuminated ...
The poem primarily targets the materialism of American life, although it also
spins into discussions of drug addiction, censorship, homosexuality, and
spirituality. The work was banned almost immediately on charges of obscenity,
but after a high-profile legal battle in which the American Civil Liberties Union
came to Ginsberg's aid, a California judge ruled that "Howl" had "redeeming
social importance" and should remain in print.
Formally, "Howl" shows the influence of two earlier American poets, Walt
Whitman and William Carlos Williams. With its long lines of free verse and
realistic, strong language, the poem comes across as a spontaneous,
uncontrollable outpouring of sentiment. Indeed, its tone of anger and despair
was an accurate harbinger of the social upheaval that would shake the United
States during the Vietnam era.
WEDNESDAY, DAY 3
Mary Cassatt
Mary Cassatt (1844-1926), an American painter who exhibited with the French
impressionists, is best known for her paintings of women and children and for
her role in introducing impressionism to the American public.
Born to a wealthy family in Allegheny City, today part of Pittsburgh, Cassatt
spent several years of her childhood in Germany. At the age of sixteen, she
began studying painting at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in
Philadephia. In 1866, she sailed to Europe, where she remained for most of her
life. After spending time in Italy, Cassatt chose Paris as her permanent home.
Until 1878, she specialized in paintings of women, often set in Parisian interiors,
which she exhibited in the States and at the Salons of 1870, and 1872 to 1876.
Impressed by the innovative works of Edgar Degas and Gustave Courbet,
Cassatt began to modify her style. After Degas invited her to join the
impressionists in 1879, she showed with them until their final exhibition in 1886.
Degas even touched up one of her paintings, The Little Girl in a Blue Armchair
in 1878. In 1877, Cassatt's mother and sister moved to Paris. Thereafter, the
painter gave up her independent, Bohemian lifestyle to live in a more
familyoriented household. This did not, however, dampen her professional
aspirations. After 1886, Cassatt began placing greater emphasis on
draftsmanship. Inspired by Japanese ukiyo-e prints, she produced a series of
eighteen colored prints in the 1890s. Her famous painting of the Bath (1892)
demonstrates her ability to combine the abstract linear designs of Oriental art
with Western themes. The mother and child are formally bound by the use of
coordinated colors and a strong centralized shape. Degas humorously called the
work "Little Jesus with his English Nurse."
Cassatt helped promote women's rights throughout her career. In 1892, she was
asked to paint a mural of the modern woman for the women's pavilion at the
Columbian Exposition in Chicago. In 1915, she contributed eighteen works to an
exhibition at the Knoedler Gallery in New York that was organized to draw
attention to women's suffrage.
Cassatt also helped influence the reception ofimpressionism in the United States.
She encouraged wealthy patrons to buy the works of her fellow artists, assisting
them in their selections. She acted as a personal consultant to Henry and
Louisine Havemeyer, whose collection of impressionist masters now hangs at
the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.
A successful artist in her own right, Cassatt purchased the Chateau de
Beaufresne outside Paris. In her later career, she increasingly focused on the
theme of mother and child. By 1900, she began suffering from cataracts, but she
continued painting for another fifteen years
ADDITIONAL FACT
1. In 1878, Cassatt went to Spain, where she studied the works of Diego
Velazquez and Bartolorne Murillo and painted a number ofworks with Spanish
themes.
THURSDAY, DAY 4
Sound Waves
Sound is a vibration that moves in a longitudinal pressure wave through matter.
Sound has all the classic characteristics of waves-frequency, wavelength,
velocity, and amplitude. Unlike electromagnetic waves such as radio waves,
microwaves, and visible light, however, sound cannot travel through the vacuum
of space. It requires a medium-gas, liquid, or solid-in order to move.
Sound begins when an object vibrates, moving the particles around it, which in
turn move the particles around them. Thus begins a chain reaction of
compression and decompression with each vibration. The waves of pressure
move in a line parallel to the initial vibration, like waves through a slinky
scrunching together and pulling apart. This is called longitudinal motion. The
number of pressure oscillations per second is call the frequency, and the distance
between points of maximal pressure is called the wavelength. We perceive
higher frequencies to have a higher pitch and lower frequencies to have a lower
pitch.
The velocity of a sound wave is the distance per unit of time that it travels in a
given direction. The velocity of sound depends a great deal on the medium
through which it is traveling. In general, the particles in solid matter have
stronger interactions than the particles in liquids and gases, which allows sound
to move more quickly through solids. This is why people put their ears to the
tracks to hear if a train is coming. The vibrations of the train travel more quickly
through the metal tracks than through the air.
The amplitude of sound refers to the amount of pressure that it creates. The more
energy put into the initial vibration, the greater the amplitude. We perceive
amplitude as loudness. As a sound wave travels over a distance, it loses
amplitude. It becomes fainter and fainter until it can be heard no more.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. The typical unit for frequency is a hertz (Hz). One hertz is equal to one
vibration per second. The human ear can hear frequencies ranging between
approximately 20 and 20,000 Hz.
2. Dogs and dolphins are particularly good at hearing the high pitches produced
by high frequencies. Dogs can hear frequencies up to 45, 000 Hz, and dolphins
can hear up to 200, 000 Hz.
3. Elephants are tuned to lower frequencies. They can hear sounds as low as 5
Hz.
4. Our ability to perceive amplitude declines with age. This is why elderly
people often require hearing aids.
FRIDAY, DAY 5
Giuseppe Verdi
Giuseppe Verdi (1813-1901) represents one of the two schools of opera: German
and Italian. In contrast to the German school, Verdi captures a style and an
overall sensibility-soulful, personality-driven, and nationalistic-that is the perfect
embodiment of the Italian operatic tradition.
Born to an illiterate innkeeper in Parma, Italy, Verdi had early success. When he
was twentysix, his first opera, Oberto, was performed at La Scala, Milan's most
famous theater, and the Holy Grail for Italian singers and composers. After a
flop or two, he re-won the hearts of Milan with Nabucco (1842), a monumental
tale about Nebuchadrezzar's invasion of Jerusalem. Over the eight years that
followed, Verdi wrote thirteen operas and earned a massive fortune. In the
following decade, he slowed his pace, but he wrote some of his most famous
operas: Rigoletto (1853), Il Trovatore (1853), and La Traviata (1853).
Until Verdi came along, Gioacchino Rossini had been the most lauded
composer of Italian opera. Rossini's works were mostly light-hearted caprices
with lots of passages that highlighted the solo voice. In addition to Verdi, the
Italian canon was rounded out by Vincenzo Bellini, Gaetano Donizetti, and
other composers of the bel canto-beautiful singing style, which flourished in the
1830s.
Verdi wrote operas full of soulful melodies and character-driven plots that dealt
with love, loss, and tragedy, but which remained lighter than the German operas.
Where Richard Wagner and his imitators in the German school dealt in
abstractions and wallowed in huge, audacious productions, Verdi focused on
very direct, realistic emotional expression and lifelike characters singing their
hearts out.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Verdi was initially rejected from the Milan Conservatory for "lacking musical
talent." He had to take private lessons instead.
2. During the struggle for Italian independence from Austria, vandals scribbled
"Viva Verdi!" in public places, using the composer's name as an acronym for
Vittorio Emanuele, Rey d'Italia ("Long live Vittorio Emanuele, king ofltaly! ),
a reference to the man who would become the first king of unified Italy.
3. One of the Italian opera master's greatest contributions is the Verdian baritone,
a tradition of writing the most expressive arias for the sonorous baritone part,
rather than the tenor, which traditionally served that purpose.
SATURDAY, DAY 6
Categorical Imperative
Compare the two commands: "Wear a coat if you want to stay warm!" and "Do
not murder!" The first command gives you a reason to obey it; it tells you what
you ought to do if you want to stay warm. If you do not have the desire to stay
warm, you have no reason to follow that instruction. In contrast, whether or not
you want to kill, most people believe the imperative "Do not murder!" still
applies to them.
Immanuel Kant used the term categorical imperative to describe the relationship
between human beings and commands like "Do not kill" and other moral laws.
Kant believed there is an unconditional moral lawa law that says what it is
permissible to do and that applies to us regardless of our desires. Therefore, the
moral law is expressed by an imperative-a command to do something, again,
regardless of our desires.
Kant described several ways of identifying the moral law, the most famous of
which is called the formula of universal law. Kant explained, "act only according
to a maxim that you could at the same time will to be a universal law." The
maxim of your action is the reason, or guiding principle of your behavior. For
example, if you borrow money from your friend and promise to repay it, having
no intention of doing so, your maxim would be: Make a false promise in order to
get money. The formula of universal law says that if you cannot desire that
everyone act according to this maxim, then the act violates the moral law. If
everyone made lying promises to get money, then no one would lend money on
the basis of promises. Therefore, when you make a lying promise, you have to
desire that not everyone else who makes such promises is lying, or your trick
wouldn't work. Therefore, your lying promise violates the moral law.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Another way Kant formulates the categorical imperative is called the formula
of humanity: `Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own
person or in the person ofanother, always at the same time as an end and never
simply as a means."
2. Kant first articulated his theory of the categorical imperative in his 1785 book
Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals.
3. Kant believed that suicide violates the categorical imperative-masturbation
too!
SUNDAY, DAY 7
Four Righteously Guided Caliphs
According to Sunni tradition, the Four Righteously Guided Caliphs were the first
four leaders of Islam. They were seen as closely following Muhammad's path.
The first of these four caliphs was Abu Bakr. Despite the objection of Shifts who
supported Ali, Abu Bakr seized the caliphate shortly after Muhammad died. He
was Muhammad's close ally and father-in-law and often led prayer in
Muhammad's absence. Abur Bakr was the caliph from 632-634 AD. His
caliphate was brief, but given the conflict with Ali and his followers, significant
for centuries to come.
Shortly before Abu Bakr died-some say he was poisoned-he suggested his
successor should be Umar ibn al-Khattab. Umar became Islam's second caliph in
634 and reigned until 644. As he was chosen, Shifts still claimed, to no avail,
that the true caliph should be Ali. Thus, Shifts view Umar as another usurper.
Sunnis, however, look upon Umar as a great leader. They praise him for resisting
the establishment of a dynasty by refusing to allow his son to succeed him.
Instead, Umar appointed six men, including Ali, to choose a caliph from among
themselves.
When Umar was assassinated by a man who held a personal grudge against him,
this group chose Uthman ibn Affan, who reigned from 644-656. Uthman is
perhaps best known for standardizing the Quran. He also greatly expanded the
Islamic empire and began the practice of appointing family members to rule his
vast lands. This practice caused unrest throughout the kingdom of Islam, but
especially in North Africa. Soldiers eventually led masses of angry Muslims to
storm the caliph's home and kill him.
After Uthman's death, Ali, who was also know as Ali ibn Abi Talib, finally
became the caliph of Islam. By this time, however, the Islamic territories had
descended into chaos. In order to avoid the many sunnis who opposed his rule,
Ali moved his capital to what is now Iraq. Ali ruled until 661 when he, too, was
assassinated by dissidents.
Ali's death marked the end of the period of the four righteously guided caliphs.
His successor, Muawiyah I, began a hereditary dynasty.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. All three assassinated caliphs, Umar, Uthman, andAli, are said to have been
killed while performing holy rites. Umar was leading prayer in a mosque,
Uthman was reading the Quran, andAli was performing his morning prayer.
2. The caliphs lasted until the twentieth century and World War I. The last
caliph, Abdiilmecid II, died in Paris in 1944.
MONDAY, DAY I
Transcontinental Railroad
Before 1869, traveling from New York City to San Francisco was a long and
dangerous trip. Between the east and west coasts of the United States lay an
inhospitable prairie. The four- to six-month trip was so difficult that many
travelers instead opted to make the voyage by sea around the tip of South
America.
The opening of the transcontinental railroad in the spring of 1869 revolutionized
the American economy by connecting the two halves of the United States and
making it possible to move goods and people easily across the West. Railroads,
which had been invented only some forty years earlier, knitted America together
and lead to a huge increase in commerce. They also brought new waves of white
settlers to the West and subsequently caused the decline of the American Indian
tribes in the region.
Although it was built by two private companies, the Union Pacific and Central
Pacific railroads, the transcontinental railroad was, from the start, a government
project. During the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln decided the country
needed a better connection to California, which had just recently become a state
in 1850. Gold had been discovered there in 1849, sparking the Gold Rush of
prospectors rushing west. The government offered the two companies huge
incentives to complete their work quickly.
Laying two bands of steel across the entire American continent was a daunting
task. The route crossed desolate plains, great rivers, and the snow-capped Rocky
Mountains. Teams of Chinese and Irish immigrants built as much as ten miles of
track in a single day. When the transcontinental route was done, after seven years
of construction, the once-arduous trip between east and west took only six days.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. One of the executives at Central Pacific was Leland Stanford, who later in life
used his railroad fortune to start Stanford University in California.
2. The two railroads celebrated the completion of the route on May 10, 1869, at
Promontory Summit, Utah, by driving a golden stake into the final length of
track. The modern-day Union Pacific no longer serves the town, however, and
the historic tracks were torn up in 1942 and melted down to aid the war effort.
3. Pay for Chinese workers on the Central Pacific began at $27 a month and was
then increased to $30 a month. Irish workers earned $35per month, with free
board included.
4. Difficult terrain in the West often forced the railroad to build tracks over
obstacles instead ofaround them. In Utah, for instance, the route crossed the
Weber River thirty-one times!
TUESDAY, DAY 2
Tennessee Williams
If Eugene O'Neill was the great tragedian of American drama and Arthur Miller
its great social conscience, Tennessee Williams (1911-1983) was the great lyrical
and thematic innovator, the one who pushed the boundaries of language and
content the furthest. His works also rank with the novels of William Faulkner as
the finest representatives of southern American literature.
The heavily autobiographical The Glass Menagerie (1944), about the
dysfunctional Wingfield family, gave Williams his first major success. In the
play, a delusional mother's overbearing tendencies alienate both her jaded son
and her disabled daughter, who has withdrawn from reality into a fantasy life
amid her collection of glass animal figurines. When the work opened in Chicago,
ecstatic theater critics practically begged the public to go see it, and initially
small audiences soon swelled to full houses.
Productions of Williams's next major work, A Streetcar Named Desire (1947),
demonstrated that his stories worked just as effectively on film as onstage. The
play's protagonist, the haughty Southern belle Blanche DuBois, is ruined by both
her own indiscretions and her run-ins with herloutish brother-in-law, Stanley
Kowalski. A Pulitzer Prize for the work solidified Williams's reputation.
Williams followed with Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1955), a searing disclosure of the
mendacity underlying the sexual and familial relationships in a seemingly
prosperous southern clan. This play won Williams another Pulitzer.
The themes that Williams explored in his works-violence, sexual frustration,
mental illness, incest, alcoholism, and homosexuality-were scandalous for their
time and shocked audiences. Williams's language, meanwhile, was among the
most innovative to grace the American stage. His characters speak in a strange,
eloquent vernacular that brings mythic weight to their struggles-a world away
from the acutely realistic dialogue that many of Williams's contemporaries
employed.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Williams, born Thomas Lanier Williams, acquired the nickname "Tennessee"
from college friends in reference to his paternal family's long history in that
state.
2. Williams disliked the 1958 film adaptation of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (starring
Paul Newman and Elizabeth Taylor) because studio censors removed all
references to the male lead's homosexuality, which was central to the original
play.
3. At the shoe factory where his father forced him to take a job, Williams worked
with a man named Stanley Kowalski, who became the inspiration for the now
iconic character in A Streetcar Named Desire.
WEDNESDAY, DAY 3
Postimpressionism
The term Postimpressionist was coined by the art critic Roger Fry for a London
exhibition ("Manet andthe Post impressionists") he organized in 1910. Frymeant
it as a catch-all designation for modern artists following the impressionists.
Included in the exhibition were works by Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, and
Georges Braque.
Today, postimpressionism carries a more specific meaning. It is used to describe
art created between roughly 1886 and 1905 by painters such as Paul Gaugin and
Paul Cezanne. These artists felt the impressionists had focused too much on the
external appearance of things and not their meaning. They also believed the
impressionists had been preoccupied with light and color. The postimpressionists
consciously rejected naturalism and representational art. They wished to
reinstate the value of contour, structure, and composition. Postimpressionist
painters were more concerned with the emotional value of art. They viewed it as
a means of self-expression.
Postimpressionism was a bridge to much of the art that would come later in the
twentieth century. Cezanne's reduction of objects to geometric forms, evident in
his paintings of Mount Sainte-Victoire and his many late still lifes, was crucial to
the development of cubism. Gauguin's creative use of intense color and his
interest in primitive culture was influential on the Fauves. Vincent van Gogh's
spirituality and subjective approach to subject matter was championed by the
symbolists. Although there is little unity in the style of all three artists, they were
bound by their desire to express feeling with visual forms.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Compared to the gregarious impressionists, postimpressionists tended to be
independent and solitary, and often, like Gauguin and van Gogh, suffered from
acute depression.
2. Because postimpressionists were concerned with structure and composition
rather than fleeting impressions of the physical world, they were more likely to
work deliberately, often making many preliminary sketches for their finished
paintings.
THURSDAY, DAY 4
X-Rays
In 1895, a German physicist named Wilhelm Roentgen was experimenting with
beams of electrons in a vacuum tube. The tube was surrounded by thick black
cardboard, which should have blocked any light coming from the beams of
electrons. But strangely, a fluorescent screen across the room started to glow
every time Roentgen unleashed the electron beams. He had discovered, quite
accidentally, a previously unknown form of radiation. It could pass through
certain materials easily, but it was blocked by others. When Roentgen passed his
hand in front the tube, the radiation passed through his skin but was absorbed by
his bones, leaving a clear image of his skeleton on the fluorescent screen. He
called the radiation "x-ray" because it was so mysterious. The name stuck.
X-rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation, just like visible light. Both x-rays
and visible light are carried in tiny energy packets called photons that are
produced by the movement of electrons, which are negatively charged subatomic
particles. Electrons move about the center of an atom in circular paths called
orbitals. When an electron drops from a higher orbital to a lower orbital, it
releases energy in the form of photons. The difference between visible light and
x-rays is that x-rays have more photons, and hence more energy.
The soft tissue of our skin is made of small atoms that readily absorb low-
energy, visible light. High-energy x-rays pass right through it. However, the
calcium in our bones, like other metallic substances, blocks and absorbs x-rays.
Lead is a large atom that absorbs x-rays completely. This is why scientists who
work with x-rays use lead shields to protect themselves from x-ray radiation,
which can be cancerous after prolonged exposure.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. X-ray machines cannot be used to see through people's clothes, but legislators
in the early 1900s were so scared they might be, they tried to have them
outlawed.
2. Throughout medical and scientific communities, x-rays are often referred to as
Roentgen rays, after their discoverer.
3. Stars, supernovas, and black holes emitx-rays, but scientists have to use
telescopes in outer space to see them because they cannot penetrate the earth's
atmosphere.
4. X-rays are actually faintly visible to the human eye when it is adjusted to the
dark. X-rays glow a dim blue-gray.
FRIDAY, DAY 5
Verdi's La Traviata and Aida
Part of a series of three early-1850s operas that established Giuseppe Verdi as an
Italian master of the genre, La Traviata (1853) is the story of a "fallen woman,"
named Violetta who falls in love with a rich man, Alfredo. Alfredo's father,
Germont, disapproves of their union and forbids their marriage. In the end, the
courtesan Violetta, who has tuberculosis, dies a long, tragic death singing an
extended aria. The piece, whose libretto was written by Francesco Maria Piavo,
is full of expressive arias and contains some of the staple solo pieces for every
operatic soprano. It is still performed widely to this day.
Aida (1870) is probably Verdi's second most famous opera. It was commissioned
by the Khedive of Egypt in 1869 to coincide with the opening of the Suez Canal
and the building of a new opera house. Verdi, a perfectionist, actually missed his
deadline and Rigoletto was performed instead. A year later, he delivered on his
promise and produced an opera about an Ethiopian slave girl, Aida, who falls in
love with an Egyptian army captain, Radames. It is, like La Traviata, an inter-
class love story, fraught with passion and tragedy. Its catchy and memorable
"Triumphal March" is one of Verdi's most familiar tunes.
For the premiere, the Egyptians spent a fortune buying French-made costumes
and hiring a cast of more than 300. Radames's helmet and sword were made of
solid silver. Verdi, who did not actually attend the premiere, was apparently
displeased with what he heard about it. He felt that such a display reduced his
work to mere entertainment, rather than art, and he retired to his country house
for several years, giving up opera in favor of gardening and tending to his
animals. However, in 1874, he returned with his famous Requiem and wrote two
more operas before he died in 1901.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. The libretto to La Traviata is based on the play La dame aux cam€lias by
Alexander Dumas, who based his story on the real-life dancer Lola Montez,
who was a lover ofFranz Liszt.
2. In the premiere of La Traviata, the diva who played Violetta, a character dying
of tuberculosis, was fat. In the final scene, when she collapsed to theground, a
cloud of dust rose from the floor, obscuring the stage.
3. At the premiere ofAida, Khedive Ismail's harem was so big that it filled three
entire loges.
SATURDAY, DAY 6
Utilitarianism
Utilitarianism is a theory about how we ought to behave. According to
utilitarians, we should always do whatever produces the greatest overall pleasure
in the world. Utilitarianism was first proposed by the English economist and
philosopher Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832) and later elaborated by John Stuart
Mill (1806-1873).
Contemporary philosophers think of utilitarianism as a form of
consequentialism. Consequentialism is an answer to the question: Which acts are
morally right to perform? Consequentialism's answer is: Whichever acts produce
the best outcome. This outlook requires that we know what state of the world is
objectively better than others. Some philosophers deny that this is possible.
Utilitarians are consequentialists who have a hedonistic idea of what is good.
They think the only objective good is pleasure. Other consequentialists believe
good includes not only pleasure, but things like respect and equality.
Some utilitarians rank the different kinds of pleasure. Bentham famously argued
that "Prejudice apart, the game of push-pin is of equal value with the arts and
sciences of music and poetry." He believed pleasure should be measured in
quantity not quality. In contrast, Mill believed the fulfillment of intellectual
desires is better than the fulfillment of merely sensual desires. He wrote, "Better
to be a Socrates unsatisfied, than a pig satisfied"
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Bentharn designed a prison he called the panopticon wherein the wardens
could observe all of the prisoners, but the prisoners could not see the wardens.
Bentham tried, but failed, to have the panopticon built.
2. Mill was the product of an educational experiment by his father and Bentham
to produce the perfect utilitarian. He began learning Latin at age three, and
Greek at eight. Later, he would blame his intense education for his depression
and emotional problems.
SUNDAY, DAY 7
Muhammad's Wives and Daughter
Muhammad remained single until the age of twenty-five, when he met Khadijah,
who was forty and twice a widow. Khadijah married Muhammad in Mecca and
became the first female convert to Islam. She was very supportive of
Muhammad as he began to receive frequent revelations from Gabriel and to
spread the religion of Islam.
Khadijah bore Mohammed six children. The sixth, a daughter named Fatima,
would later go on to marry Ali, the fourth caliph (according to Sunnis) or the
first imam (according to Shiites). Fatima died shortly after Muhammad passed
away in 632 AD.
Throughout Muhammad's time in Mecca, he remained a monogamous man.
However, after fleeing Mecca for Medina in order to avoid critics of his
teachings, his followers became more concentrated and outspoken. They looked
upon Muhammad as a leader and expected him to take many wives. After
Khadijah died, he chose to oblige his followers. Many of the wives he
subsequently took are often considered politically motivated. The most
significant of these wives was Aisha, daughter of Abu Bakr, who, according to
Sunnis, later became first caliph of Islam.
Sunnis believe that Aisha was Muhammad's favorite wife, recounting that he
died with his head in her lap. Aisha then supported the next three caliphs, Abu
Bakr (her father), Umar, and Uthman. When All rose to power, however, she
opposed his rule and led an army against him in present-day Iraq. Ali easily
defeated her army, but let her return to Medina to live out the rest of her life.
MONDAY, DAY I
Native Americans
At first, the Nez Perce, an Native American tribe that had lived in the Pacific
Northwest for thousands of years, had an amicable relationship with the whites
who began to settle in the area in the nineteenth century. But in 1863, the US
government decided to impose a new treaty on the tribe that forced them onto a
tiny reservation. Washington wanted to make room for more settlers in the tribe's
homeland.
Outraged by the betrayal, the Nez Perce revolted in 1877. The United States
Army sent William Tecumseh Sherman, the infamous general who had wreaked
havoc in the South during the Civil War, to quell the rebellion. Cornered after a
few months of fighting, the chief of the Nez Perce assembled his weary fighters
to announce that he would surrender to the Americans: "Hear me, my chiefs!"
Chief Joseph said. "I am tired. My heart is sick and sad. From where the sun now
stands I will fight no more forever."
Chief Joseph's eloquent surrender speech, which was widely circulated at the
time, was seen as a eulogy not just for his tribe but for an entire defeated
civilization that had once existed in the American West. By the end of the
century, all organized resistance had been crushed. The massacre of the Sioux
tribe at Wounded Knee in South Dakota in 1890 was the last armed
confrontation between whites and natives.
Placed onto reservations, Native Americans remain some of the nation's most
impoverished US citizens. A third of Native Americans live below the poverty
line. The Pine Ridge Sioux reservation, the site of the Wounded Knee massacre
in 1890, is the most impoverished place in the United States. The US
government evicted Indians from their land in the name of progress, but Native
American communities in the West are still recovering from the devastation.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. The great Apache warrior Geronimo was one ofthe last chiefs to resist whites
in the Southwest. Defeated but world-famous, he appeared in President Teddy
Roosevelt's inaugural parade in 1905.
2. The ancestors ofNative Americans are believed to have crossed into Alaska
from Siberia, in present-day Russia, about 15, 000 years ago.
TUESDAY, DAY 2
William Shakespeare
Few would dispute that William Shakespeare (1564-1616) was the world's
greatest playwright in any language. His impact on Western culture over the past
four hundred years cannot be overstated.
Despite exhaustive research, little is known about Shakespeare's personal life.
He was born in Stratford-upon-Avon, England, where he probably had a short
formal education. After marrying a woman named Anne Hathaway, he embarked
on a career as a playwright, moving to London and working as an actor and
director at the Globe Theatre, which he co-owned with other shareholders in his
company. Shakespeare's brilliance was widely acknowledged during his lifetime,
and his works were immensely popular with both aristocratic and common
audiences.
Shakespeare is most famous for his thirty-eight plays, which scholars
traditionally group into several categories. Histories, such as Richard II and
Henry V, portray real historical figures -typically kings of England-and explore
ideas of leadership and personal integrity or villainy. Tragedies, such as Hamlet,
Macbeth, and King Lear, explore the monumental ramifications of individuals'
flawed actions and decisions. Comedies, such as A Midsummer Night's Dream
and Much Ado About Nothing, present alternately lighthearted and probing
takes on romance, fueled by cases of mistaken identity and typically culminating
in marriage. Others, such as Measure for Measure and The Tempest, are more
difficult to categorize, combining elements of different genres. Over the
centuries, these thirty-eight diverse scenarios have proved to be timeless, fruitful
ground for reinterpretation by directors and actors, who use them as lenses
through which to explore contemporary concerns.
Shakespeare also wrote significant poetry, including 154 sonnets about love, art,
beauty, and other topics. Beyond the stylistic and formal influence of these
poems, the English words and expressions that Shakespeare coined are virtually
without number. They range from nowcommonplace vocabulary, such as
"lackluster" and "sanctimonious," to more poetic turns of phrase, such as "one
fell swoop" and "pomp and circumstance" England recognized this literary and
linguistic influence immediately and, upon Shakespeare's death, knew it had lost
one of its greatest minds. Indeed, to borrow a phrase from Hamlet, it is probable
that the world "shall not look upon his like again."
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Although Shakespeare's authorship ofsome ofhis plays andpoems has been
contested, scholars have found little more than circumstantial evidence to
support this argument.
2. In Shakespeare's day, all dramatic roles, including those of female characters,
were played by male actors. This convention added an additional layer of
complexity to some of his comedies-such as As You Like It-that feature female
characters who cross-dress to hide their identity.
WEDNESDAY, DAY 3
Paul Gauguin
Paul Gauguin (1848-1903) was a major figure of the postimpressionist
movement. He is remembered today for his paintings of Tahiti, his relationship
with Vincent van Gogh, and his influence on twentieth century art.
Gauguin, the son of aleft-wing journalist, was born in Paris in 1848. His
maternal grandmother had been the daughter of a Peruvian nobleman. When his
father had to leave Paris for political reasons, the family moved to Lima, Peru,
where Gauguin spent four years of his childhood.
Gauguin began studying art relatively late in life. He initially joined the
merchant marines and then became a stockbroker in Paris. At first, he merely
collected art, but soon he began painting in his spare time. In 1876, he exhibited
his works at the official Salon. By 1879, he had joined the impressionists.
When the stock market crashed in 1882, Gauguin moved to Copenhagen to work
as a salesman for a canvas manufacturer. Shortly thereafter, he devoted himself
to art full-time. Restless and impatient by nature, Gauguin moved from place to
place seeking a quiet, noncommercial haven. In 1886, he stayed in Pont Aven, a
provincial town in Brittany, for six months. Next he traveled to Rouen,
Copenhagen, Panama, and Martinique. Upon his return to Pont Aven in 1888, he
painted The Vision after the Sermon (Jacob Wrestling with the Angel). With
distorted perspective and symbolic rather than realistic imagery, Guaguin tried to
capture the impact of a sermon on the listeners' minds. The hard contours and
vivid colors of the canvas reveal his fascination with Japanese prints and
medieval stained glass.
In 1888, Vincent van Gogh invited Gauguin to join him in Arles, where he hoped
to establish an artists' colony. Incompatible in temperament, the two ended up
quarrelling. For the next few years, Gauguin shuttled between Brittany and Paris.
Longing for a more primitive lifestyle, he set sail for Tahiti in 1891, where he
was disappointed by the lack of indigenous artifacts. Inspired all the same by
Javanese carvings and pre-Columbian pottery, Gauguin began painting scenes of
the island and its traditions.
In 1893, Gauguin sailed back to Paris, where he wrote Noa Noa, a romanticized
account of his experiences in the South Seas, which he illustrated with
deliberately crude woodcuts. He remained in France for two years, during which
time he managed to alienate many of his friends with his ostentatious exoticism.
Frustrated by the poor reception of his work, he sold off his possessions and
moved permanently to the South Seas in 1895.
Three years later, he attempted suicide after painting his bleak masterpiece
Where Do We Come From, What Are We, Where Are We Going? In 1901, after
he began receiving a steady stipend from his dealer in Paris, he moved to a
remote island in the Marquesas where he lived until his death in 1903.
THURSDAY, DAY 4
The Atom
An atom is the tiniest unit of an element that has all the chemical properties of
that element. The concept of the atom dates all the way back to 530 BC, when
the Greek philosopher Democritus defined the atom as a particle of matter so
minute that it could not be divided into smaller parts. The modern concept of the
atom has subcomponents-notably electrons, protons, and neutrons-but the idea is
the same. It is the basic building block of all matter.
Modern atomic theory states that all elements are made of atoms, and all atoms
of any element are the same. Elements such as hydrogen, carbon, oxygen,
sodium, potassium, gold, and uranium combine with each other through
chemical reactions to form compounds. For example, hydrogen and oxygen
combine to form water, and sodium and potassium combine to form table salt.
The basic structure of an atom is a nucleus surrounded by electrons, although the
vast majority of an atom consists of empty space. The nucleus is a dense core
made of neutrons and protons. Neutrons have no charge and weigh slightly more
than protons, which have a positive charge. The number of protons in the atom
determines what type of element it is. Hydrogen has one proton, while uranium
has ninety-two. Elements gain and lose protons through fusion and fission, but
not through chemical reactions.
Electrons are negatively charged particles with an almost negligible mass. The
movement of electrons around the nucleus continues to be one of the most
debated topics in chemistry and physics. Early models of the atom depicted
electrons orbiting the nucleus much in the same way the earth orbits the sun.
Now developments in quantum mechanics have lead scientists to believe that
electrons move in complex waves called orbitals, encircling the nucleus at
distinct energy levels.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Current theories of the universe's formation suggest that, after the Big Bang,
the universe was too hot for atoms to form. The creation of atoms presumably
did not happen until 379, 000 years after the Big Bang, when temperatures fell
to 3, 000 K
2. In the early universe, it is thought that hydrogen made up 75 percent of the
atoms, helium made up 24 percent, and the other elements made up the
remaining 1 percent.
3. Protons and electrons are made of still smaller particles called quarks, and
electrons may be made ofsmaller particles called leptons.
4. It was believed that ninety-two elements occur naturally on earth, but recently
scientists discovered that plutonium, which has ninety four protons, also exists
naturally on earth.
FRIDAY, DAY 5
Richard Wagner
Richard Wagner's (1813-1883) massive contribution to opera would earn him a
place near the top of any list of the most influential men of the nineteenth
century. But more important, perhaps, is his contribution to art overall, embodied
by his concept of Gesamtkunstwerk-the idea of a total art work that unites music,
art, movement, theater, poetry, and philosophy. There were several generations
of thinkers, artists, and musicians-including T. S. Eliot, Arnold Schoenberg,
Ernest Hemingway, and Pablo Picasso-who followed Wagner and were strongly
influenced by his thought.
A ruthlessly competitive egomaniac, Wagner was born in Leipzig, where he
attended university. In 1833, his brother got him a job as chorus master at
Wurzberg, one of the few successes of his frustrating early career. While at
Wurzberg, he wrote Rienzi (1842) and The Flying Dutchman (1843), both
moderate successes, but he lived extravagantly and even spent some time in
debtors' prison. Wagner moved on to the Saxon court at Dresden, where he
reached maturity with Tannhauser (1844) and Lohengrin (1848). In 1849, he
supported a revolutionary political movement and a warrant was subsequently
issued for his arrest. Wagner fled to Weimar, where Franz Liszt helped him gain
amnesty.
In the following years, Wagner composed his famous Ring Cycle of four operas,
as well as Tristan and Isolde (1859), Die Meistersinger (1861), and Parsifal
(1882). Wagner saw himself as embodying the spirit of German music. He was a
socialist, and along with Liszt, he formed the idea of the "Music of the Future," a
theory that touted the superiority of German music and pioneered revolutionary
methods in harmony, structure, and composition.
Wagner inspired conflict in listeners like no other composer before him. Some
people loved his music for its revolutionary genius but hated his loathsome
character, but many other contemporaries were indifferent to the defects of his
character but disliked the scale and complexity of his music. In Wagner's final
act of narcissism, he established a festival in 1872 in the Bavarian town of
Bayreuth devoted entirely to his music. Wagner died in 1883 of a heart attack in
Venice.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Wagner was virulently anti-Semitic. His Judaism in Music, published in 1850,
attacked his Jewish contemporaries, even some like the composer Giacomo
Meyerbeer, who had once been his friend.
2. Wagner seduced and married Cosima Liszt von Bulow, then the wife ofone
ofWagner's best friends and the daughter ofFranz Liszt. Afterwards, Liszt
refused to speak to Wagner for many years. On the other hand, Herr von Billow
remained on good terms with Wagner, conducting his operas and conceding
that Wagner, as the greater genius, had a right to Cosima.
SATURDAY, DAY 6
George Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
G. W. F. Hegel (1770-1831) was born in Stuttgart, Germany. Hegel hoped to find
an academic job at the University of Jena, then the philosophical center of
Germany, but his plans were cut short by the invasion of Napoleon Bonaparte.
Hegel fled and worked for many years as, among other things, a newspaper
editor and high school principal, before becoming a professor in Heidelberg, and
then Berlin. By the time of his death in 1831, Hegel was the most famous
philosopher in Germany, with students flocking to hear his lectures.
Hegel's philosophical system is bewilderingly complex.
However, a few general features can be noted.
First, Hegel grants great importance to history. For Hegel, history was the
process by which spirit-in German, geist-comes to recognize itself as spirit. It is
hard to say what Hegel means by this. On one reading, spirit is the totality of
norms by which human beings live. A norm is a rule that says what we ought to
do, or what we are allowed to do-our social mores. To say that "spirit comes to
recognize itself as spirit" is to say that through the course of history, human
beings collectively realize that they themselves are the authors of the norms that
govern their lives, that these norms have arisen for determinate reasons
throughout history, and have been refined and changed for reasons.
Hegel had a very interesting theory about how systems of norms, which he
sometimes called "forms of consciousness," change through history. He argued
that they undermine themselves. A system of norms undermines itself when it
starts to appear unjustified, or unreasonable, according to its own standards.
When this happens, argued Hegel, a new system of norms arises, which resolves
precisely the problems of the previous form of consciousness. Thus, when we
examine the systems of norms that have governed human life throughout
historypolitical, ethical, religious, aesthetic, or philosophical-we find a
succession of forms of consciousness, where the transition from each form to the
next appears reasonable. Thus, when we examine our world, we see our norms
are the product of a historical process governed by reason.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Hegel believed his own philosophical system was the final form of
consciousness, the final system of norms that would never be overcome.
Therefore, he believed "history, "as he understood it, had ended.
2. Hegel called the process by which forms of consciousness undermine
themselves, giving way to new forms of consciousness, "dialectic."
3. Hegel once described Napoleon Bonaparte as "world history on horseback."
SUNDAY, DAY 7
Muawiyah I
Muawiyah ibn Abu Sufyan, who ruled under the name Muawiyah I, succeeded
Ali and was the first leader of Islam after the four righteously guided caliphs.
Muawiyah was born in Mecca circa 602 AD. His father strongly disagreed with
Muhammad's teachings and when Muawiyah became a Muslim, he had to hide
his faith from his own family. After Muhammad conquered Mecca and
eliminated idolatry, Muawiyah became a scribe. Eventually, as the Islamic
empire expanded, Muhammad sent Muawiyah and his brother to Syria, where
they lead the Islamic army against the Byzantines.
Under Caliph Umar, Muawiyah was named the governor of Syria. As governor,
he raised a Syrian army that was strong enough to hold off Byzantine advances,
and also to capture Cyprus and Rhodes.
Muawiyah's goals changed drastically when Ali, the fourth and final righteously
guided caliph, was installed. Ali chose not to punish the murderers of Uthman,
the third caliph, and Muawiyah saw this as a sign that All was involved with the
murder himself. Muawiyah began to raise an anti-Ali following in Syria. In order
to stop this uprising, Ali led his armies against Muawiyah in the Battle of Siffin.
Although Muawiyah was losing the battle, he convinced Ali's soldiers to stop
fighting and hold a religious arbitration to decide the victor. During this
arbitration, Muawiyah convinced many of Ali's soldiers to turn against their
leader. This distraction allowed Muawiyah time to send a large number of his
followers to Egypt.
When Ali died, Muawiyah, holding both Syria and Egypt, was the most
powerful Muslim and the logical choice to replace him. He ruled from 661-680
AD.
Unlike his predecessors, Muawiyah appointed his son, Yazid I, to replace him. In
order to both establish the dynasty and continue the old traditions, Muawiyah
installed a group of loyalist nobles who would vote for the next caliph. However,
these nobles were in the caliph's pocket, rubber-stamping his heir. So began a
series of hereditary dynasties, the first of which was the Umayyad, which ruled
from 661-750 AD.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. The first three caliphs ruled from the Arabian Peninsula. Ali moved his capital
to Iraq, and Muawiyah ruled from Damascus, Syria.
2. According to tradition, Muawiyah convincedAli's troops to submit to
arbitration by placing Qurans on his army's lances. Ali's soldiers, unwilling to
harm the holy book, stopped fighting.
MONDAY, DAY I
Otto von Bismarck
Otto von Bismarck (1815-1898) was a nineteenth-century politician and
diplomat who is considered the founder of the modern nation of Germany. Prior
to the mid-1800s, Germany was a patchwork of tiny, quarrelling states. The
fragmentation of Germany had been a legacy of the Holy Roman Empire, which
had gradually dissolved into dozens of pieces before finally disappearing in
1806. Working on behalf of Kaiser Wilhelm I, Bismarck was able to consolidate
these states into one unified country.
Bismarck himself was born in Prussia, one of the more powerful German states,
as the son of a military officer. He entered politics in his thirties as a
conservative. Despite his initial apprehension, he embraced the cause of German
unification wholeheartedly.
Appointed the Prussian chancellor, or prime minister, Bismarck used diplomacy
and the threat of force to overcome opposition to unification. He also
encouraged the growing sense of German nationalism. In 1870, Bismarck
shrewdly provoked a war with France, which convinced many other German
states to unify with Prussia. A united German empire emerged after Prussia's
quick victory over France in 1871.
Bismarck then had the total trust of the Kaiser, and he largely ran the new
German empire. Bismarck was not a liberal, but he did undertake a number of
reforms to strengthen the German state. He developed a common currency,
enacted many administrative reforms, and established a single set of laws for the
whole country in an effort to solidify the country's unity.
The German empire Bismarck founded was short-lived, however. After
Wilhelm's death, Wilhelm II, his successor, forced Bismarck to resign shortly
after coming to the throne. Without Bismarck's steady hand, German foreign
affairs took a turn for the worse. Wilhelm II made the fateful choice to drag
Germany into World War I, a decision that ended the empire. And the forces of
nationalism that Bismarck exploited to unify Germans in the nineteenth century
had disastrous consequences in the twentieth century.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Bismarck was nicknamed the `Iron Chancellor"for his reputation for
toughness and determination.
2. Bismarck twice survived assassination attempts, first by a student in 1849 and
again in 1874 by a barrelmaker.
3. A gigantic German battleship named after Bismarck was sunk by the British in
1941 in a pivotal World War II naval battle.
4. The capital ofthe US state ofNorth Dakota, which is heavily German-
American, is named after Bismarck.
TUESDAY, DAY 2
Fyodor Dostoyevsky
Fyodor Dostoyevsky (1821-1881) was the undisputed master ofthe
psychological novel. During aliterarycareer spanning four decades, he
displayed unprecedentedand arguably still unmatched-understanding of human
nature, especially the torturous emotional states of guilt, despair, and
preoccupation with death.
The hardship and tragedy that Dostoyevsky faced in his life probably only
enriched his fiction. Born in Moscow to a rigidly Russian Orthodox family, he
was stunned by the sudden death of his father in 1839. Although Dostoyevsky
followed his father's urging and was educated as an engineer, he disliked the
work and decided to become a writer. His first novel, Poor Folk (1846), won him
great praise with critics, but his career was derailed when he was arrested in
1849 for taking part in a radically leftist publishing operation. After being
subjected to a mock execution with a last-minute "reprieve," he spent four years
at a labor camp in Siberia. This traumatic experience left an indelible mark on
the tone and content of Dostoyevsky's works.
In the 1860s, Dostoyevsky hit his literary stride, penning the novella Notes from
Underground (1864), about a bitter, neurotic recluse who is unable to function
socially in the outside world, and his early masterpiece Crime and Punishment
(1866), which dissects the guilt and misery of a young man who has killed an
elderly woman. The latter work is particularly notable for its psychological depth
and its conclusion that a criminal's internal self-recrimination after a crime is far
worse than any punishment society can levy.
As Dostoyevsky grew older, he rejected the atheist politics of his youth and
returned to the Russian Orthodoxy of his ancestral roots. His novel The Idiot
(1868-1869) depicts a tragic Christ figure, and the great masterpiece of his later
career, The Brothers Karamazov (18791880), has been called the most
significant Christian novel ever written, infused as it is with Russian Orthodox
morality. In this giant novel, three sons of a murdered father tackle problems of
good and evil and Christian faith in very different ways.
Though detractors criticized Dostoyevsky's dense and often humorless style, the
penetrating detail of his character studies is unquestioned-especially in his
explorations of the minds of criminals, the mentally unstable, and others on the
margins of society. Beyond their literary legacy, these characterizations
influenced the nihilistic and existential philosophers of the twentieth century,
from Friedrich Nietzsche to Albert Camus.
ADDITIONAL FACT
1. Throughout his life, Dostoyevsky suffered from epilepsy, which worsened
significantly during his years at the Siberian labor camp.
WEDNESDAY, DAY 3
Vincent van Gogh
Vincent van Gogh (1853-1890), one of Holland's greatest artists, has become the
symbol of the tormented, misunderstood genius. Although he sold only one
painting in his lifetime, his works are now worth a fortune.
The son of a Protestant minister, van Gogh was born in Zundert, Holland, in
1853. By 1869, he was representing the art dealers Goupil & Company, first in
the Hague, then in London. Unsuccessful in business, he left the company in
1875 to train for the ministry. He worked a brief stint preaching to miners in
southwestern Belgium, but he was dismissed from the clergy after he gave away
all his possessions. His superiors were concerned he was adhering to Christian
principles too literally. Van Gogh was active as an artist for only ten years,
between 1880 and 1890. He taught himself to paint from copying prints and
reading books. He was influenced by realist painters, as is clear in his Potato
Eaters (1885), a work that owes a great deal to Jean-Francois Millet in terms of
subject matter and technique.
In 1886, van Gogh left Holland for Paris, where he shared quarters with his
brother Theo, an art dealer who supported him through most of his life. Itwas
through Theo thatvan Gogh met Claude Monet, Paul Gauguin, Camille Pissarro,
and Georges Seurat. Like many modern artists of his time, he also developed an
interest in Japanese prints. After two years of intense artistic activity, van Gogh
moved to Arles in the south of France, to realize his ambition of painting
peasants. In October 1888, he invited Gauguin to join him. On Christmas Eve
that same year, the two artists quarreled and van Gogh cut off his own ear.
According to a newspaper report, he presented it to a prostitute. The incident
was the first sign of his mental illness, probably a form of epilepsy.
By May 1889, van Gogh committed himself to a psychiatric hospital in Saint
Remy. It was there that he painted possibly his most famous work, Starry Night.
Twelve months later, he moved into the home of the homeopathic doctor, Paul-
Ferdinand Gachet, near Paris. Severely depressed, van Gogh shot himself in the
chest in July 1890 and died two days later. After his death, van Gogh's reputation
escalated rapidly. An exhibit of his works in 1901 featured seventy-one of his
paintings. In 1987, his Irises sold for £47. Three years later his Portrait of Doctor
Gachet was bought for a record-breaking $82.5 million. Today van Gogh's 1,250
paintings and 1,000 sketches are spread throughout the world, the largest single
collection being the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Purportedly, van Gogh's final words were, "Sadness will last forever."
2. Some scholars believe van Gogh suffered from bipolar disorder while others
have claimed that his mental illness stemmed from his excessive absinthe
consumption. Still other scholars say van Gogh tasted too many ofhis own
paints.
THURSDAY, DAY 4
Elements: Metals, Nonmetals, and Metalloids
An element is a substance that cannot be changed into another substance through
chemical reactions. All elements are made of atoms with a distinct number of
protons, positively charged subatomic particles. For example, all carbon atoms
have six protons, and all gold atoms have seventy-nine protons. Ninety-three
elements exist naturally on earth, and an additional twenty can be made
artificially. There are three basic classifications of elements: metals, non metals,
and metalloids. Three-quarters of elements are metals, although nonmetals are
more commonly found in nature.
Metals are characterized by the ease with which they share and give up
electrons, tiny negatively charged subatomic particles. When a metal atom yields
an electron, it becomes a positively charged ion called a cation. Metals are often
thought of as cations swimming in a sea of electrons. The free-floating electrons
keep metal atoms bound yet flexible, giving metals their district properties: They
are ductile (capable of being drawn into wire) and malleable (capable of being
pounded into a sheet). For the same reason, metals also conduct heat and
electricity well and readily form compounds with other elements. They tend to
be lustrous solids at room temperature.
Nonmetals often gain electrons and form rigid chemical bonds. They are brittle
and break easily. Nonmetals usually do not reflect light, and they do not conduct
electricity or heat very well. However, they make excellent insulators. Although
there are only thirteen known nonmetals, almost all life on earth is made out of
six of them: hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur. The
other nonmetals are mostly inert gases, which rarely interact with other
elements.
Metalloids have some characteristics of metals and some of nonmetals. For
example, silicon and germanium are semiconductors, which means they conduct
an electrical current under specific conditions. This is why they are so useful in
computers and calculators.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Mercury is the only metal that is liquid at room temperature.
2. Oxides of metals are basic, while oxides ofnonmetals are acidic.
3. Most metals react quickly with oxygen in the air, which, for example, is what
causes iron to rust. Pure sodium explodes when it is exposed to oxygen.
Palladium, platinum, and gold are rare metals that do not react with oxygen,
which is why they make for such beautiful and expensive jewelry.
FRIDAY, DAY 5
Wagner's Ring Cycle
Richard Wagner's masterpiece is the gargantuan Der Ring des Nibelung (1874),
also known as the Ring Cycle. The four-part opera, consisting of Das Rheingold
(The Rhinegold), Die Walkure (The Valkyries), Siegfried, and Gotterdammerung
(The Twilight of the Gods), lasts almost seventeen hours and is meant to be
watched on four successive nights. It is considered by some to be the greatest
operatic work of all time.
Wagner began working on the piece in 1848, his idea being to create a
monumental work that could recapture the magic of Greek Tragedian Theater-to
unite art, music, theater, poetry, and philosophy in one giant Gesamtkunstwerk,
or "total work of art."
Wagner wrote all four librettos, basing them on the legend of the German-Norse
mythical hero Siegfried. In the story, Wotan, king of the gods, has built a
fortress, Valhalla, with the help of a race of giants. In order to pay his debt to
them, Wotan steals a powerful ring from the dwarf Alberich. Alberich curses the
ring, but that does not deter Wotan from continuing to pursue it. Most of the
story revolves around the adventures of Wotan's son Siegmund and grandson
Siegfried as various powers try to retrieve the ring, which is guarded by a
dragon. Also playing a major role is Wotan's daughter, the Valkyrie Brunnhilde.
In the end, the curse destroys everyone in its wake, Valhalla is consumed by fire,
and a new era of the world is ushered in.
The music is incredibly lavish and complex, based on the idea of a leitmotif a
short, beautiful melody that represents a character, a feeling, an object, or an
emotion. Each leitmotif is recontextualized to fit new scenes. No opera house
would take on the challenge of performing the cycle, so Wagner staged it at his
own Bayreuth festival for the first time in 1874.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. The Valkyrie character in the Ring Cycle is the origin of the famous opera
caricature of a fat soprano wearing a Viking helmet and a brass brassiere.
2. The Ride of the Valkyries"from Die Walkure is the famous music
accompanying the helicopter drop scene in Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse
Now.
3. The Norse mythology that inspired the Ring Cycle is also the source of1. R.
R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings and the subsequent blockbuster movies.
SATURDAY, DAY 6
Karl Marx
"The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways;
the point, however, is to change it."
-Karl Marx, Theses on Feuerbach (1845)
Karl Marx (1818-1883), the intellectual father of communism, had more impact
on the twentieth century than any other philosopher. Born in 1818 in Trier,
Germany, to an ethnically Jewish family that had converted to Christianity, Marx
initially sought an academic career, but he was rebuffed due to his radical
political leanings. Marx worked as a journalist for several years before he took
part in the 1848 revolution in Germany. When that revolution failed, he fled to
London, where he lived for the rest of his life.
In Marx's theory of history, the means of economic production explain historical
and political change. At any given time, a society has certain means of
producing economic goods such as food and forms of shelter. The means of
production determine a particular economic arrangement. For instance,
agriculture required a large number of people to till the land and a few people to
oversee this work. The economic arrangement, in turn, determines the political
system. In the case of agriculture, the farmers worked for the lord, who owned
the land and protected them from other nobles in exchange for a portion of their
crops. Revolutions occur when the economic arrangement and political system
become obstacles to the productive forces of the economy
In each economic system, there is a division of labor, so there is a division of
people into classes. Marx saw capitalism-which he characterized as the
economic system in which goods are created not to be used but to be exchanged-
as the product of a long historical development. In capitalism, the class division
is exaggerated to the breaking point. A vast number of workers-the proletariat-
toil in squalor, while a tiny minority of people who own the means of
production-the bourgeoisie-are made wealthy. Marx predicted that capitalism
would bring about its own demise. As capitalism thrives, he argued, it will create
a larger and larger proletariat living in ever worsening conditions. Eventually,
the workers will revolt and establish a different, cooperative, economic system-
one in which each gives according to his abilities and takes according to his
needs.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Marx coauthored many of his works with Friedrich Engels, the son of a
German industrialist. Their collaborations include the multi-volume Capital,
which Marx regarded as his masterwork.
2. Marx described the state that would follow the collapse of capitalism and
herald true communism as the "dictatorship of the proletariat. "
SUNDAY, DAY 7
al-Ghazali
Abu Hamid Muhammad ibn Muhammad al-Tusi al-Ghazali (1058-1111), or
simply al-Ghazali, was one of the most influential Islamic theologians and
philosophers. He was born in 1058 in Tus, part of what is today Iran.
Al-Ghazali studied and taught Shafi law, one of four legal schools within Sunni
Islam. By the age of thirty-three, al-Ghazali had established himself as one of the
field's leaders and was appointed head of the Nizamiyyah College in Baghdad.
He served in this role for four years and remained very popular throughout his
tenure.
One of al-Ghazali's foremost works is "The Incoherence of Philosophers." In this
work, al-Ghazali claimed that events in the world are determined by God's
present whim. This essentially eliminates all other sources of causality in nature
and puts everything in God's immediate hands.
In the work, al-Ghazali criticized ancient philosophers such as Plato and
Aristotle and Muslims who follow in their line of thinking. He claims that these
philosophers were wrong to apply reason when answering religious questions.
Al-Ghazali said that if reason could be used to prove absolute truths about
religion, such as the existence of God, then everyone would agree to these truths.
Instead, al-Ghazali believed rational thought could not be the source of religious
answers.
In 1095, al-Ghazali underwent a spiritual change. He left the college and
traveled throughout Arabia. He went to Damascus, Jerusalem, Mecca, Medina,
Egypt, back to Baghdad, and finally to his hometown, Tus. It was during this
time that al-Ghazali began to follow one of the many Sufi orders.
Al-Ghazali had long been a believer in the Asharite school of thought, which
holds that the true nature of God is unknowable. This school credits al-Ghazali's
own "The Incoherence of Philosophers" as its most important work. So it was no
great leap that during his travels, alGhazali finally determined the mysticism of
Sufism offered the best way of connecting with God. Given his immense
popularity, al-Ghazali's alignment with the then emerging Sufi orders is credited
with establishing Sufism's credibility in mainstream society.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Philosophically, al-Ghazali's work amounts to philosophical skepticism,
similar to the British school of thought arising from George Berkeley and
David Hume, but appearing 700 years earlier.
2. Al-Ghazali's major critic was Averroes, also known as An Rushd, whose
major work ofcriticisrn was called "Incoherence of The Incoherence. "
MONDAY, DAY I
Elizabeth Cady Stanton and the Suffrage Movement
"The history of mankind is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations on the
part of man toward woman."
-Elizabeth Cady Stanton, "The Declaration of Sentiments,"
Seneca Falls Conference, 1848
Elizabeth Cady Stanton (1815-1902) was an abolitionist, temperance advocate,
and tireless promoter of women's rights in nineteenth century America. Born in
1815 in upstate New York, Stanton spent her entire career campaigning for
women's suffrage, a goal that remained elusive during her lifetime. Stanton
died in 1902, seventeen years before women finally got the right to vote in the
United States.
In 1848, the year the American suffrage movement began in earnest, the idea
ofwomen casting ballots seemed preposterous to many. Only the tiny Pitcairn
Island in the Pacific Ocean allowed female suffrage. Few colleges in the United
States educated women, and women's property rights were sharply limited. But
in that year, Stanton and a few other women organized a convention in Seneca
Falls, New York, to plot a course for women's rights.
At the Seneca Falls convention, Stanton, along with Lucretia Mott, authored a
Declaration of Sentiments signed by the delegates. The document, self-
consciously modeled on Thomas Jefferson's Declaration of Independence,
argued "that all men and women are created equal." For the next fifty years,
Stanton worked to convince other Americans of that proposition.
The suffragists took their cause seriously, at a time when society deemed
women's involvement with politics unladylike. When Stanton married, she
insisted on dropping the word "obey" from her wedding oath. Like later
progressives, the early feminists endured the shallow mockery of reactionaries.
Many American men and women regarded the suffragists, like the abolitionists,
as only the latest in a procession of insufferable Northern liberals bent on
upending society and tradition.
Stanton did not live to see the ratification of the nineteenth amendment to the
US Constitution granting women the right to vote in 1920, but her colleagues
were careful to pay homage to the woman who had set the movement in motion
at Seneca Falls. Her fellow agitator, Susan B. Anthony, said, "I want you to
understand that I never could have done the work I have if I had not had this
woman at my right hand."
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. The first US state to permanently grant women the right to vote was
Wyoming, which was admitted to the Union in 1890.
2. Many ofthe early suffragists, includingAnthony, were Quakers, a small,
pacifistic Christian sect in Britain and the United States whose members were
also leaders in the abolition and temperance movements.
3. A handful of countries still do not permit women to vote: Bhutan, Brunei, and
Saudi Arabia.
TUESDAY, DAY 2
Lolita
VladimirNabokov'sLolita (1955) was among the most brilliant and controversial
novels of the twentieth century. The novel's notoriety initially overshadowed its
literary merit, but as the din subsided, readers and critics realized that Lolita
broke new ground not only by virtue of its content but also with its narrative
voice and technique.
Born in 1899 in Russia, Nabokov was educated in England, where he started a
writing career. After publishing several novels, he moved to the United States to
become a professor. Along the way, he developed a stylized, self-consciously
intellectual voice that readers tended either to love or hate.
Lolita portrays the tortured sexual obsession of a middle-aged professor,
Humbert Humbert, for a twelve-year-old girl. Originally from Paris, Humbert
moves to the United States and takes a room at a widow's house after seeing her
young daughter, Dolores, sunbathing in the garden. He goes so far as to marry
the widow in order to stay close to Dolores, or " Lolita," but the widow soon
dies. Although Humbert and Lolita indeed consummate their relationship, the
capricious girl loses interest. Eventually Humbert realizes that, for once, his lust
has actually transformed into real love; Lolita, however, rejects his advances.
As a narrator, Humbert is skillful and expressive yet delusional and wholly
unreliable, twisting the facts with graceful, poetic language that disguises the
truly disturbing nature of his obsession with young girls. By his account, it is
Lolita who seduces him, and his preoccupation with "nymphets" is merely a
byproduct of his tragic childhood romance. Humbert's famous opening lines set
the novel's playful but unsettling tone:
Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul. Lo-lee-ta: the tip of the
tongue takinga trip of three steps down the palate to tap, at three, on the teeth.
Lo. Lee. Ta.
Upon finishing Lolita in 1955, Nabokov could not find a willing publisher in the
United States; the work was published in France, where critics found it either
brilliant or utterly obscene. The novel was widely banned and did not appear in
the United States until 1958, when it became a bestseller. Today, it is prized as a
perceptive literary investigation of sexuality and repression, as well as a prime
example of the unreliable narration that was a hallmark of postmodern literature.
ADDITIONAL FACT
1. From his youth, Nabokov was fluent in Russian, English, and French; his
early works are primarily in Russian, his later ones, including Lolita, in
English.
WEDNESDAY, DAY 3
Starry Night
Starry Night (Cypress and Village) is one of Vincent van Gogh's best-known
paintings. It depicts a simple subject-the Provence landscape beneath a
starstudded sky-but it is often interpreted as a deeply spiritual work.
Van Gogh painted Starry Night on the evening of June 19, 1889 while residing at
the asylum in Saint Remy. The painting (twenty-nine by thirty-six inches) is
dominated by a vast expanse of sky with swirling clouds, stars, and a moon. At
its base appears a small village, overshadowed by a church, the steeple of which
pierces the sky. The village is nestled amid rolling blue hills. To the left, an
outline of a fiery cypress towers into the sky.
According to some scholars, Starry Night reveals van Gogh's admiration for the
American poet Walt Whitman. Commenting on Whitman's work, van Gogh
wrote of the "great starlit vault of heaven, a something which, after all, one can
only call God and eternity in its place above the world."
In this particular case, van Gogh did not work directly from nature but from
several preparatory sketches. In the final version, he modified the shape of the
actual San Remy church by adding a steeple, an architectural feature more
typical of his native Holland.
Various meanings have been read into the painting. Some scholars believe that
the dark windows and door of the church imply that inspiration is not to be
found in organized religion but in nature, here symbolized by the magnificent
cypress. Others have claimed that the twisted cypress and dynamic sky represent
van Gogh's tormented soul. Some have even claimed that the painting is not
symbolic at all, but represents the actual constellations as they appeared on that
evening in 1889. Observations from the Hubble Space Telescope suggest that
van Gogh may have been looking at V838 Monocerotis, one of the most
mysterious stars in the Milky Way.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Today the painting is on permanent view in the Museum ofModern Art in
New York City.
2. The swirling brushstrokes of paint make the trees and sky resemble elemental
forces, such as fire and water.
3. Van Gogh's use of thick paint swirls to suggest powerful emotion anticipated
the expressionist movement of the early twentieth century.
THURSDAY, DAY 4
Chemical Bonds
Chemical bonds join together two or more atoms to form compounds such as
water, salt, and oil. Atoms combine in order to form more stable structures of
electrons, tiny negatively charged particles that encircle the center of atoms. In a
stable compound, the total energy of the compound is lower than the energy of
the individual atoms. There are three basic types of chemical bonds: covalent
bonds, ionic bonds, and metallic bonds.
In covalent bonds, atoms share one or more pairs of electrons. There are single
bonds, sharing only one pair of electrons, double bonds sharing two pairs, triple
bonds, and rarely quadruple bonds, but these tend to be explosively unstable. In
general, covalent bonds tend to be the strongest and most stable chemical bonds,
especially covalent bonds between nonmetals. There are two types of covalent
bonds: nonpolar bonds and polar bonds. In nonpolar bonds, electrons are
distributed evenly across the molecule, but in polar bonds, electrons tend to
gather on one end of the molecule. This creates negative and positive poles on
the molecule. The oppositely charged ends become attracted to each other,
structurally binding molecules together, as in ice and water.
In ionic bonds, atoms donate their electrons to other atoms. Often ionic bonds
form between metals, which lose electrons easily, and nonmetals, which gain
electrons easily. When a metal atom loses an electron, it becomes a positively
charged ion called a cation. When a nonmetal atom gains an electron, it becomes
a negatively charged ion called an anion. Anions and cations join in ionic bonds.
Ordinary table salt, sodium chloride, is an example of a metal, sodium, joining
with a nonmetal, chlorine, through an ionic bond.
Metals tend to share metallic bonds. Since metals readily lose electrons, they are
often thought of as cations floating in a sea of electrons. Even when different
metals combine in alloys, they still share free-floating electrons, giving metals
their strong yet flexible properties.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Technically, pure ionic bonds don't exist. They all have a degree ofcovalent or
metallic bonding as well.
2. Covalent bonds were first described by Gilbert N. Lewis in 1917.
3. Quintuple covalent bonds exist in some chromium compounds.
FRIDAY, DAY 5
NineteenthCentury Nationalism
For more than a century, Vienna was the global center of art music. But in the
1840s, revolutions in Austria, Hungary, Germany, Italy, and France helped spur
nationalist movements that rose against imperial powers in a struggle that would
grow as the nineteenth century progressed. In the musical world, composers
expressed their support of nationalist movements by hearkening back to the folk
music of their homelands. Their nationalism would eventually give way to the
cosmopolitan internationalism of the modernists, but for a time it was the
dominant inspiration for many composers.
In Paris, Frederic Chopin (1810-1849) wrote polonaises and mazurkas to honor
his native Poland and in 1831 he wrote a piece commemorating the doomed
Polish uprising against the Czar. Czech nationalism was expressed by three
composers: Bedrich Smetana (1824-1884), Antonan Dvorak (1841-1904), and
Leos Janacek (1854-1928). Dvorak's Slavonic Dances (1878) and Symphonies
No. 4 (1874) and No. 6 (1880) used Czech folk themes and rhythmic patterns.
Richard Wagner (1813-1883) and Richard Strauss (1864-1949) thought that
German music was the most advanced and pure music, a notion that would find
a welcome home in the politics of the twentieth century. And, Piotr Ilyich
Tchaikovsky (1840-1893) and Nikolai Rimsky- Korsakov (1844-1908) drew on
Russian traditional music in service of the Czar's interests.
The most famous piece of nationalist music is probably Tchaikovsky's 1812
Overture (1888), a piece commissioned by the Russian government to
commemorate the Russian victory over Napoleon. Tchaikovsky reportedly wrote
it against his better judgment, but the result is one of the most popular pieces of
classical music ever written. Tchaikovsky composed the piece using music from
the Russian national anthem and several Orthodox hymns, scoring it for
orchestra with live artillery cannons.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. In 1933, Richard Strauss became the president of the Reichmusikkammer, the
Nazi party's ministry of music.
2. Nationalism often re-emerged in the twentieth century in the compositions
ofAaron Copland and Dmitri Shostakovich.
3. The height of nationalist music coincided with two important events: the
unification of Germany and the establish ment ofan independent Italy.
SATURDAY, DAY 6
Friedrich Nietzsche
Probably no philosopher has been so often, or so wildly, misinterpreted as
Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900). Born in the German town of Rocken bei
Lutzen, Nietzsche became a celebrated young scholar of classical philology,
achieving a professorship at the University of Basel, in Switzerland at the age of
twenty-four. Nietzsche abandoned his teaching duties due to ailing health and
collapsed in 1889, an invalid, both mentally and physically. He died insane in
1900, cared for by his sister.
One central theme in Nietzsche's philosophy is what he called the "re-evaluation
of all values," in which he encouraged people to question their moral, scientific,
and aesthetic values. Nietzsche believed many of the values that form the basis
of European culture- especially Christian morality-needlessly inhibit life and joy.
According to Nietzsche, many of these values were invented by the weak and
resentful as a tool to gain power over the strong. He believed that Christianity,
with its celebration of the meek and humble, is the victory of the sick against the
healthy. For every system of values, and every philosophical system, Nietzsche
asked, what kind of life does it serve?
Another important Nietzschean idea is that of the "eternal recurrence"-the notion
that the world will repeat itself exactly as it was, forever. Because of the eternal
recurrence, we will all live our lives, exactly as we have, down to the minutest
details, again and again. Nietzsche offers this as a test: What kind of person
would be willing to repeat all of the moments of his or her life, even the pettiest
and most humiliating ones, for all eternity?
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Many experts believe Nietzsche had syphilis, contracted from a prostitute or
when he was a medical orderly in the Franco-Prussian war.
2. Nietzsche's sister, Elizabeth Forster-Nietzsche, was aproto-Nazi who tried to
twisther brother's philosophy for her own political ends. He himself was a
withering critic of both German nationalism and antiSemitism.
3. Nietzsche's concept ofthe "Superman"(Ubermensch) is a term the Nazis used
to describe the idealAryan hero. Nietzsche did not say exactly what the
Superman would be like, but it was clear that he would not be warlike or
violent.
4. Nietzsche hada close friendship with the composer Richard Wagner.
Eventually, the friendship was broken, after which Nietzsche was savagely
critical of Wagner in his writings. Some evidence suggests that the cause of the
break in their friendship was that Wagner had inappropriately suggested to
Nietzsche's doctor the cause of the young man's vision problems-excessive
masturbation!
SUNDAY, DAY 7
Mahdi
Muslims believe Muhammad taught that before the end of time, a man will
emerge from Islam known as the Mahdi. This man will be a member of
Muhammad's Ahl al-Bayt, or lineage, and will turn the world into a pure and
peaceful place. There are many beliefs about the nature of the Mahdi, and, as is
common, Shiite and Sunni Muslims differ greatly.
According to Sunni Islam, the Mahdi has not been born yet. When he is born, he
will be born in Medina, where Muhammad died, and his parents will be named
Abdullah and Aamina, the same as Muhammad's. Sunnis also believe that the
Mahdi will emerge at the age of forty, the same age at which Muhammad had his
first revelation, and that both the Mahdi and a returning Jesus will inhabit the
earth for many years.
Shiites, on the other hand, take a radically different view. They believe that since
the death of the prophet Muhammad, Islam has been lead by a series of imams,
beginning with Ali. The twelfth and final of these Imams was born in 868.
However, he is not yet dead.
When the twelfth imam was five, his father, the eleventh imam, passed away.
The boy's uncle was about to give the prayer service when the five-year-old
Mahdi declared that only an imam could perform the honor and proceeded to do
it himself. After this, he went into occultation, or disappearance, where he
remains. Shiites believe that he is still alive today, named Muhammad al-Mahdi,
and will eventually reemerge.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Muhammad claimed that even ifthe day of judgmentarrived, and the Mahdi
had not appeared, then that day would continue forever until the Mahdi arose.
2. In Frank Herbert's Dune, the main character is said to be the Mahdi.
MONDAY, DAY I
Andrew Carnegie
Andrew Carnegie (1835-1919) was a Scottish immigrant to the United States
who amassed one of the greatest fortunes of the nineteenth century. Carnegie
retired in 1901 as the richest man in the world-and then spent the rest of his life
giving money away. By the time of his death in 1919, Carnegie had donated
more than $350 million to charity, an unheard of sum at the time. To this day,
many towns across America are home to a Carnegie Library built with money
donated by the immigrant philanthropist.
Carnegie owed his fortune to nineteenth century America's insatiable appetite for
steel. After emigrating from Scotland with his family at age thirteen in 1848,
Carnegie went to work at a cotton mill. But he realized that steel presented an
enormous opportunity. In 1865, at age thirty, he started the Carnegie Steel
Company in Pittsburgh to produce metal for the railroads and bridges
crisscrossing the rapidly industrializing North American continent. Carnegie was
famous for holding down costs, and his company eventually acquired many of
its competitors.
At the age of sixty-five, Carnegie sold the company and retired. He had
cultivated an image of himself as a friend to the working class with humble
roots, and in his book The Gospel of Wealth Carnegie argued that the rich should
give their wealth away to the less fortunate. In retirement, that is exactly what
Carnegie did. His donations funded the construction of 2,500 libraries in the
English-speaking world, including more than 1,600 in the United States. He also
sponsored museums, scientific expeditions, and the famous New York musical
hall named in his honor.
In the United States, Carnegie's rags-to-riches life story suggested that anyone
could pursue the American dream and become rich. His name endures as a
symbol of American opportunity and also for the responsibilities of the wealthy.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Among his many other philanthropic pursuits, Carnegiepaid for the
installation ofmore than 7, 000 church organs across the United States, some
ofwhich still remain in use.
2. Carnegie often returned to Scotland after earning his fortune and purchased
Skibo Castle in the Scottish Highlands as a summer house. The castle remained
the property of his family for many years, but it is now an exclusive vacation
resort. Madonna and Guy Ritchie married there in 2000.
3. Carnegie was an ardent supporter oftee Union cause during the Civil War. He
served as superintendent of military railways and telegraphs, coordinating the
transportation of troops to the battlefield.
4. A gigantic dinosaur-the diplodocus carnegii-is named in honor of Carnegie,
who financed the expedition that first unearthed the creature.
TUESDAY, DAY 2
The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn
Mark Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884) remains one of the
most widely read pieces of nineteenth-century American literature. Though
much has been made of its history as a banned book, it is an entertaining,
moving story that appeals to younger and older readers alike.
Huck Finn is a young boy from the town of St. Petersburg, Missouri. Because
Huck's father, Pap, is a violent drunk and often absent, Huck lives in the care of
an old widow, whose attempts to "sivilize" Huck cause the boy much
consternation. When Pap returns to town, he kidnaps the boy to a remote cabin,
beating him viciously. To escape, Huck fakes his own death and ventures onto an
island in the middle of the Mississippi River, where he encounters Jim, a
runaway slave owned by the sister of Huck's caretaker.
Huck and Jim set off down the river in the raft, encountering a rogues' gallery of
criminals, slave hunters, con men, and other examples of the worst society has to
offer. After myriad misadventures, Jim is captured but eventually rescued by
Huck and his friend Tom Sawyer. Ultimately, all are returned to safety, and at the
end of the novel, Huck decides that he wants to go off and explore the still
untamed American West.
The novel centers on Huck's development and his struggles to reconcile the
dictates of society with his own feelings and instincts, especially regarding his
relationship with Jim. Growing up in the South, Huck has long been taught that
it is wrong to help an escaped slave. But Jimby far the most caring and decent
character in the novel-quickly becomes the object of Huck's trust and almost a
father figure. In the end, Huck comes to understand that society's rules are not
always correct and that his own sense of right and wrong is often the more
valuable guide.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. To this day, Huck Finn is banned in many US school districts because of its
frequent use of the word "nigger" even though Twain's usage only adds realism
to a story that preaches tolerance and decries the stupidity ofracism.
2. Twain coined the now common term for the period in US history between
Reconstruction and World War I-the "Gilded Age" inan eponymous
novelpublishedin 1873.
3. In Twain 's earlier novel The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876), Tom and
Huck discover a criminal's stash ofgold-the same money that Pap tries to get
his hands on in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.
WEDNESDAY, DAY 3
La Grande Jatte
Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte by (1884-1886) Georges
Seurat (1859-1891) is one of the best-known works of postimpressionism. The
painting, executed in Seurat's famous pointilist or divisionist technique, captures
a tranquil scene of people walking, sitting, fishing, and sailing along the banks of
the Seine River near Paris.
In the years leading up to La Grande Jatte, Seurat had been studying and
experimenting with optics. Influenced by Ogden Rood's treatise on color,
Theorie scientifique des couleurs (1881), he came up with a scientific system for
translating natural luminosity and color with thickly applied and superimposed
dots or dashes of paint. His Bathers at Asnieres of 1883 demonstrates his earlier
application of this technique to a large, outdoor scene.
Seurat began working on the 82-by-121-inch canvas of La Grande Jatte in 1884,
completing it in time for an exhibition in 1885 that was subsequently cancelled.
Thereafter he reworked many sections of the painting in a technique he called
chromo-luminarism before submitting it to the eighth and last impressionist
group show. From the moment that he conceived the painting until its
completion, Seurat made fifty-nine preparatory sketches on paper, panel, and
canvas. These provide a fascinating insight into his creative process.
The painting is set on the northwest shore of the island of La Grande Jatte, which
faces the town of Courbevoie across the Seine. The scene includes forty-eight
people, eight boats, three dogs, and a monkey. A standing couple on the right
dominates the composition. The woman carries two leashes, apparently for the
dog and monkey at her feet. To her left is a group of three men, one of whom is
casually dressed and smoking a pipe while sprawled out on the lawn. Nearby-in
contrast to the lounging man-is an elegantly attired man, sitting stiffly upright. A
child wearing a shimmering white garment in the center of the painting is the
only figure looking out at the viewer. Receding into the distance are more people
set in groups or by themselves. The scene is alternately relaxed and formal. The
figures appear somewhat flat as if cut from cardboard and arranged carefully in
the landscape.
According to his own testimony, Seurat intended the painting to be a
monumental record of contemporary life, worthy of comparison to such
venerable ancient masterpieces as the frieze on the Parthenon. In 1924 Frederick
Clay Bartlett purchased La Grande Jatte for the Art Institute of Chicago, where it
can be seen today. A recent musical by Stephen Sondheim, Sunday in the Park
with George, brought the canvas to life on stage.
THURSDAY, DAY 4
The States of Matter
The three states of matter-solid, liquid, and gas-are defined by the shape and
volume of the substance in question. Solids have a finite volume and shape.
Liquids have a finite volume, but their shape is determined by whatever is
holding them. Gases have no definite shape or volume and will expand infinitely
if nothing contains them.
Matter is made of molecules, and molecules are made of atoms. It is the nature
of atoms and molecules that determine the state ofmatter. All molecules have
kinetic energy; they move. The more they move, the more likely they are to
move apart from each other. But molecules, especially molecules of the same
type, tend to be attracted to each other. The tension between kinetic energy and
molecular attraction results in the different phases of matter. This tension is
greatly influenced by temperature and pressure. Increases in temperature make
molecules move faster, raising kinetic energy, while increases in pressure bring
molecules closer together, heightening molecular attractions.
In solids, molecules move very slowly, vibrating or rotating, and the attraction
between molecules is very strong. They can arrange themselves in rigid
structures called crystals or amorphous structures like glass. Depending on
temperature and pressure, the same type of molecule can be arranged into many
different structures. For example, solid carbon can form graphite or diamonds.
The different structures are called phases.
In liquids, the kinetic energy is high enough and the molecular attraction is low
enough so that molecules slide by each other easily. Most substances have only
one liquid phase, but other substances have more than one, for instance there are
two phases of liquid helium. In gases, the molecules are barely attracted to each
other and move freely. If molecules gain enough kinetic energy and have almost
no pressure, their electrons-tiny negative subatomic particles-will detach
themselves from the rest of their atoms. This phase, called plasma, occurs in
stars.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Ice-solid water-has eight different phases.
2. One phase ofliquid helium is extremely strange. Ifpoured into a container, it
will settle at the bottom, crawl up the inside, crawl over the rim, and then crawl
down the outside.
3. At extremely low temperatures, molecules barely move at all. This allows for
bizarre phases ofmatter called superfluids, supersolids, and Bose-Einstein
condensates.
FRIDAY, DAY 5
Piotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky
Disparaged by critics in his own day, there are multiple views of what Piotr
Ilyich Tchaikovsky (1840-1893) contributed to the classical music canon. He
was either a bombastic, overly-sentimental hack who had little grasp of form, or
he was a nationalist who composed straight from the heart and was bold enough
to follow his instincts. Whatever the case, Tchaikovsky's orchestral works have
claimed a place in history, and they are at least an accessible introduction to the
world of art music.
Born in a mining town 900 kilometers east of Moscow, Tchaikovsky was a
fragile, sickly child. He was sent to a boarding school and later a conservatory in
Saint Petersburg. He became a professor of harmony at the Moscow
Conservatory in 1866 and joined a small circle of nationalist composers. In
Moscow, he wrote his Symphony No. 2 "Little Russian" (1872) and several other
works utilizing Russian themes.
At first Tchaikovsky was not fully appreciated in his home country. When his
Piano Concerto No. 1 (1875) was played for the great Russian master
Rubinstein, it was deemed "worthless and unplayable." It premiered in Boston to
wide acclaim, however. Tchaikovsky did find acceptance in Russia later in his
career, beginning with works like his Symphony No. 4 (1878).
Tchaikovsky's most famous works are the 1812 Overture (1888) and the music
for the ballets Swan Lake (1875) and the perennially-performed Nutcracker
(1892).

SATURDAY, DAY 6
Modality
You could have been a little taller, or a little shorter. You could have had more
siblings, or fewer. All of these things are possible, but not actual. Aspects of the
world that could have been different are described by philosophers as contingent.
However, there are ways the world could not have been different. For instance,
2+2 could not have added up to anything other than 4. Aspects of the world such
as 2+2=4 are necessarily true.
The problem of modality is the problem of identifying which features of the
world are contingent, which are necessary, and how to tell the difference. The
question of modality is a question that would remain even if we knew every truth
about the world. We could still ask: Which of these truths are necessary, and
which are contingent?
Almost all philosophers agree that logic is necessarily true: if Socrates is a man,
and all men are mortal, then it follows necessarily that Socrates is mortal. It is
impossible for the first two to be true, and the third false. Likewise, almost all
philosophers agree that mathematics is necessary: it is impossible that 2+2 not
equal 4. However, philosophers disagree about other issues, such as whether the
physical laws of the universe are necessary. They also disagree about whether
there are necessary truths about individual things. For instance, is it necessary, or
only contingent, that you are a human being? Could you have existed without
being a human being-say, as a cat or a groundhog? Or, a religious example: If
there is a God, does he exist necessarily?
Philosophers also ask what about the world determines that some things are
possible, while others are impossible. While some philosophers have argued that
this question cannot be answered, others have argued that something is possible
whenever there is a "possible world" in which it is true.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Baruch Spinoza (1632-1677) believed that everything is necessary and that
there is no contingency in the world.
2. Rend Descartes (15961650) believed that God decides what will be necessary
and what contingent. If God had chosen otherwise, it would have been false,
for instance, that 2+2=4.
SUNDAY, DAY 7
Jihad
The Arabic word jihad has controversial connotations. Although it is frequently
translated and understood as "Holy War," it also means "exertion in the path of
God."
The exertion that jihad describes is the effort that one must undertake as one
struggles with Islam. This effort may involve the inner struggle to become a
better Muslim or the struggle against evil through writing, sermons, and
scholarship.
Much emphasis has been placed on the Holy War aspect of jihad, not only
because of recent events, but also due to Islam's history. After fleeing to Medina,
Muhammad raised a following and then attacked and overthrew Mecca. From
there, he proceeded to spread Islam throughout Arabia. Traditionally, Muslims
divided the world into two parts: Dar al-Islam and Dar a1- Harb. Dar al-Islam
was the land of Islam, where Islam was already prevalent. Dar al-Harb, on the
other hand, was the land of war, or the land that Islam had yet to reach.
Some claim this suggests that until the world is comprised solely of Muslims,
Muslims will be forced to wage war. However, this is not necessarily the case.
As the Muslim empire spread throughout the Arabian Peninsula, and into Africa,
Asia, and Europe, Muslims encountered more people who were already
monotheists. They also suffered military defeats. Thus, the Muslim expansion
slowed and became less violent. Many Muslim leaders began to espouse a vision
ofpeaceful coexistence.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Among Muslim mystics a distinction is made between lesser jihad andgreater
jihad. Holy War was seen as lesser jihad while struggling with one's soul was
seen as greater jihad.
2. Muhammad is often remembered as d great warrior, thus strengthening the
argument fora militant Islam. However, it should be noted that only during the
last ten years of his life did he wage war. For his first fiftythree years, he was a
merchant and then a priest.
MONDAY, DAY I
Vladimir Lenin
At the start of the twentieth century, an autocratic monarchy struggled to
maintain control over Russia. From his giant Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg,
the last czar, Nicholas II, ruled over a vast and troubled kingdom of wealthy
landowners, impoverished peasants, and starving factory workers. Protesters
demanded more political freedoms, but the czar's army repeatedly suppressed the
growing clamor for reform, hanging dissidents or sending them to prison in
Siberia. For the Russian people, World War I was the last straw. Horrified by the
carnage-1.7 million Russian soldiers died in the name of European power
politics-the Russian people finally toppled the czar in 1917.
Initially, Russian reformers hoped to replace the monarchy with a liberal
democracy akin to France and Great Britain. But a middleaged political activist
from the Russian town of Simbirsk had different ideas. Within a year of the
czar's abdication, Vladimir Ilyich Lenin (1870-1924) and his communist
supporters had seized power across Russia. They rejected liberal democracy and
sought to build a new kind of government organized around Marxist political
philosophy. Out of the shards of the old czarist empire, Lenin and the
communists created a new nation: the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics
(USSR).
Under the czar, Lenin spent many years in exile or in prison for his subversive
activities. During this time, he honed a set of ideas that would come to be known
as Leninism. Leninism attempted to translate the philosophy of Karl Marx into a
blueprint for actually governing a communist state. In practice, Leninism in the
Soviet Union led to huge suffering for the Russian people. Before his death in
1924, Lenin's government had outlawed private enterprise, executed thousands,
and triggered a famine that killed millions of Soviet citizens. Still, by the
measure of industrial production, Lenin's revolution was a success. By the end of
World War II, the Soviet Union was a military superpower. Joseph Stalin took
power in the Soviet Union after Lenin's death in 1924, consolidating the grip of
the communist party during his ruthless thirty-year reign.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. After Lenin's death, his body was embalmed and placed in a mausoleum in the
center ofMoscow, where it remains today.
2. Lenin is the inspiration for the character of Old Major in the famous book
Animal Farm by George Orwell.
3. The deposed czar and his family were murdered by the Soviets in 1918.
TUESDAY, DAY 2
Madame Bovary
Gustave Flaubert's Madame Bovary (1857) was one of the first great works of
nineteenth-century realism. Although the novel's story may seem cliched today,
its realistic depiction of an unfulfilled woman pursuing adultery was
revolutionary at the time. In fact, the plotline caused public outrage, leading to
an obscenity trial for Flaubert and his publisher.
Born in 1821, Flaubert lived during a time of great social change in France.
After the French Revolution of 1789, the fading aristocracy gave way to a rising
middle class of businessmen and merchants. Flaubert, who had been groomed
for the intellectual elite, detested the crass, materialistic values of the nouveau-
riche. This venom is evident throughout his works, particularly Madame Bovary.
Young Emma Bovary grows up in the countryside, educated by nuns. After she
weds a bourgeois doctor of only average wealth and minimal competence, the
dull realities of marriage simply do not meet her idealized expectations. Even
motherhood fails to lift her spirits; she longs for something like romantic love,
but her aspirations remain aimless and fickle. Emma embarks on two adulterous
affairs, one of which ends in heartbreak, the other in boredom. Although her
husband remains entirely oblivious, Emma becomes indiscreet and careless with
money, accumulating massive debts and ultimately resorting to attempted
prostitution. In a fit of despondency, she kills herself with poison.
Madame Bovary's status as a literary classic stems from both its subject matter
and its groundbreaking stylistic approach. Whereas novelists and poets of the
romantic movement had maintained their optimism about the human spirit, the
much more pessimistic Flaubert was analytic and detached in his approach to
Emma's situation. He also manipulated prose in innovative ways, subtly altering
his language in different parts of the narrative to correspond with changes in the
mood of the story. After Flaubert's death, other masters of realism, from Leo
Tolstoy to Thomas Hardy, created masterpieces that are greatly in his debt.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Flaubert was renowned for laboring endlessly over individual word choices,
believing that he had to find le seul mot juste-"the unique precise word"-
forever), description and situation.
2. Madame Bovary took Flaubert more than five years to write. Friends urged
him to put the project aside, but he devoted himself exclusively to it until he
finished.
3. Flaubert's subtitle for Madame Bovary was Moeurs de province, or
`Provincial Customs -a snide articulation ofhis distaste for the bourgeoisie.
WEDNESDAY, DAY 3
Expressionism
The expressionist movement was initiated by artists who deliberately rejected
naturalism in art. Rather than attempt to capture the visible world objectively,
expressionists transformed it to meet their needs. Although they did not share a
unified style, they gravitated toward the use of dissonant colors, unbalanced
composition, and crude, childlike, or primitive techniques. Turning their backs
on the refined classicism of Renaissance and Academic painters, they sought
inspiration in the emotionally charged paintings of sixteenth century German
masters, such as Albrecht Durer and Matthias Grunewald.
Although Vincent van Gogh and Paul Gauguin contributed much to the
development of expressionism, the beginning of the movement is usually dated
to 1905, the year in which a group of artists under the leadership of Henri
Matisse first exhibited their works in Paris. These men came to be known
fauves, or "wild beasts," due to their use of shockingly bright colors and
distorted figures.
While the fauves were stirring controversy in Paris, German Expressionism was
taking root in Dresden. It was here that Ernst Kirchner inaugurated the
association known as Die Brucke, (the Bridge), by which he meant the bridge
between the old and new worlds. Inspired by postimpressionists, the fauves, and
African wood carvings, members of the Bridge developed a harsh and jagged
style to depict subjects such as urban street scenes. One of the most important
members of the group was Emil Nolde, whose painting Maskenstilleben III
typified their artistic priorities. After 1905, expressionism sprung up
simultaneously all over Europe. Major representatives of the movement include
Oskar Kokoschka and Egon Schiele in Austria, Chaim Soutine and Georges
Rouault in France, Edvard Munch in Norway, and James Ensor in Belgium. In
1911, Vasily Kandinsky and Franz Marc founded Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue
Rider) a short-lived association of artists based in Munich, who fused
expressionist, symbolist and cubist principles, and led the way to abstraction.
Expressionism is sometimes used as a catch-all term for all the movements (e.g.,
cubism, futurism, Dada, and surrealism) that rejected classicism in the first half
of the twentieth century. Expressionism declined in the mid-1930s when Nazi
authorities proclaimed it decadent. At that point, many of its representatives
sought refuge in the United States and other safe havens.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Although fauvists are often seen as the first expressionists, they tended to
evoke positive emotions, while their counterparts in other countries were more
inclined to depict fear, anger, frustration, and misery.
2. Expressionists often worked in woodcut, a medium they appreciated because
it resulted in rough outlines and harsh contrasts of black and white.
THURSDAY, DAY 4
Photochemistry
All light comes to the earth in packets of energy called photons. Visible light is
just a small sliver of light's full range, called the electromagnetic spectrum,
which encompasses radio waves, microwaves, infrared light, ultraviolet light, x-
rays, and gamma rays. Each type of light has a characteristic wavelength,
frequency, and energy level. For example, radio waves are so long and low in
energy that they pass straight through most types of matter without affecting
them. Ultraviolet light, on the other hand, has just enough energy to set off
chemical reactions that burn your skin. Light also triggers chemical reactions
that allow us to capture images on film.
Black and white film is made of a thin protective plastic layer, an emulsion of
gelatin and grains of silver salt crystals, also known as silver halides. Silver
halides are sensitive to the exact wavelength, frequency, and energy level of
visible light. Upon exposure, they absorb light and change into silver. The more
light, the darker the silver salt crystals become. That is why negatives are darkest
in the places that are the lightest in real life. When light is shone through the
negative onto photographic paper, which is also coated in an emulsion of silver
halides, the dark places on the negative let the least light through. The light
places on the negative let the most light through. In this way, the image on the
photographic paper turns into the opposite of the negative.
In color film, the emulsion is made up of layers sensitive to the separate
frequencies of red, green, and blue light. When the film is developed, the
layering of colors creates the full range of color that we see in everyday life.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. The gelatin used in emulsion is a purified form of the gelatin found in JELL-
O.
2. The first picture was taken by Joseph Niepce in 1827 He exposed to the sun a
metal plate coated with a photochemical called bitumen. Eight hours later, he
had a permanent image.
3. Daguerreotypes were the first commercially successful type ofphotograph.
They were developed in poisonous mercury vapors, which led to an untimely
end for many careless photographers.
4. The most expensive photograph in history sold for $400,000. It is a portrait
ofpainter Georgia OKeeffe's hands.
FRIDAY, DAY 5
Antonin Dvorak
The finest Czech musical export, Antonin Dvorak (1841-1904) was born in
Bohemia and played viola in the Prague National Orchestra. In 1874, Dvorak's
Symphony No. 3 won him a national prize in Vienna, as well as the attention of
Johannes Brahms, who was an adoring fan. In 1891, Dvorak was given a post as
a professor of composition at the University of Prague, where he stayed only a
year. He then accepted a post as director of the National Conservatory of Music
in New York at a huge salary of $15,000.
After a five-month farewell tour of Bohemia, Dvorak embarked on his trip to
America. His stay there would prove to be one of the most unhappy, yet
productive periods of his life. He wrote his Symphony No. 9, "The New World
Symphony" (1893) as well as his Concerto for Violin (1893).
The New World Symphony was composed while Dvorak was taking a vacation
to the small Czech-speaking town of Spillvale, Iowa. On the train ride across the
prairie, he was inspired by the landscape to compose his own interpretation of
America. The resulting symphony suggests both the energy and the great spaces
of America. As it turns out, the American folk tunes and rhythms that Dvorak
incorporated into this work suggest to some listeners the homesickness of a
wanderer for his own native land.
In this symphony, like most of Dvorak's orchestral works, we see a composer
who has a basic romantic sensibility, but is nonetheless grounded in a classical
grasp of form. What sets Dvorak apart from others is his devotion to folk
melodies. Symphony No. 5 (1875) has Bohemiansounding melodies and
Symphony No. 6 (1880) utilizes a type of Czech dance called a furiant. Later in
his career, Dvorak's work was informed by the lyrical, loosely-formed genre of
the tone poem.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Dvorak is also famous for his dazzling string quartets.
2. After almost three years in America, Dvordk returned to Prague and lived
contentedly composing operas and tone poems.
3. Dvordk read a Czech translation of Longfellow's poem "Hiawatha" while he
wrote the New World Symphony.
SATURDAY, DAY 6
Pragmatism
Pragmatism is a philosophical tradition that originated in the United States with
the work of Charles Sanders Peirce (1839-1914), William James (18421910),
and John Dewey (1859-1952). Many regard pragmatism as America's most
original contribution to philosophy.
Peirce, James, and Dewey differed in their specific beliefs, but they shared a
general approach to philosophy. Before the pragmatists, many philosophers
believed in the correspondence theory of truth. According to that theory, the
truth of some belief or sentence depends on whether it matches some abstract
reality independent of the mind and of language. Those who believe in that
theory say it is possible that all of our best evidence is incorrect, that all our
beliefs about the world, supported by the best possible experimentation, might
turn out to be wrong. The pragmatists were united in their rejection of that
outlook. All three of them understood truth to be a much easier proposition.
They all maintained that, in some sense, what is true is simply what we have the
best evidence to believe.
The pragmatists also believed that sentences and beliefs should be evaluated in
terms of what role they play in facing life's practical problems. For the
pragmatists, the term practical included moral, religious, and political life as
well. Metaphysics was fine, as long as it helped us navigate our way through the
world.
Both William James and John Dewey made significant contributions outside the
realm of philosophy as well. James was an early pioneer of empirical
psychology in America and author of the highly influential Principles
ofPsychology. Deweywrote extensively on education, arguing that schools
should be more flexible and take into account the creativity and individuality of
children. He saw his pragmatism as closely connected to progressive politics, of
which he was a dogged and famous champion in the early twentieth century.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Dewey preferred to call his theory "instrumentalist."
2. Peirce was an early pioneer of semiotics, the study ofsigns.
3. William James was the brother ofHenry James, the great American novelist.
Their father, Henry James Sr., was a famous philosopher in his own day. The
Jameses' father raised his children with the explicit goal ofmaking them
geniuses.
SUNDAY, DAY 7
Gabriel
The angel Gabriel plays important roles in Islam, Christianity, and Judaism,
often called on to relay important messages from God.
Gabriel is the single most important angel in the Islamic tradition. According to
Islam, Gabriel appeared before Muhammad while he was meditating in a cave.
Gabriel then recited the Quran, verse by verse, commanding Muhammad to
memorize each line and spread it to others. The Quran is believed to be a series
of quotes directly from God to Gabriel and onto Muhammad. Great attention is
paid to the actual sound of the words as they resounded in the cave. This
explains the Muslim emphasis on the actual spoken word of the Quran and why
all prayers must be said in the original Arabic.
In Christianity, Gabriel is believed to be one of God's archangels. Some writings
say there were three such higher-ranking angels, including Michael and Raphael.
Others say there were seven. Gabriel makes several appearances in Christian
tradition to relay God's messages. Gabriel appears before Zacharias and tells him
that John the Baptist, a predecessor of Christ, will be born to Elizabeth. Gabriel
also appears before Mary to tell her that she will give birth to Jesus. This
interaction with Mary is known as the Annunciation.
In Judaism, Gabriel interacts twice with Daniel. The first time, after Daniel has
seen a vision from God that he cannot understand, God sends Gabriel to help
him interpret. The second time, Gabriel appears before Daniel and predicts the
end of the Jews's exile in Babylon.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Gabriel's name means "man of God."
2. Mormons believe that Gabriel and the Noah who built the Ark are actually the
same person.
3. Various religious traditions have attributed several titles and properties to
Gabriel: the color blue, the element water, the direction west, and the moon. He
is also known in places as the angel ofdeath, angel of vengeance, angel of
resurrection, angel of revelation, angel ofinercy, and angel of annunciation.
MONDAY, DAY I
Treaty of Versailles
The Treaty of Versailles officially ended World War I. Signed in Paris in 1919
after months of negotiations, the treaty rearranged the map of the world. On the
losing side, Germany lost much of its territory in Europe and its entire colonial
empire. Germany was forced to accept responsibility for starting the war and
agreed to pay financial reparations to the victorious Allies. The victors, France
and Great Britain, occupied the former Ottoman territories in the Middle East.
Even at the time, many critics decried the treaty as a giant missed opportunity.
The American President, Woodrow Wilson, had sailed to Paris with an idealistic
plan to end imperialism and encourage international cooperation through a new
League of Nations. But Britain, and especially France, had little interest in
idealism. After losing millions of soldiers in the war, they wanted retribution.
The result was a treaty that humiliated the Germans.
In the four years it lasted, from 1914 to 1918, the war had created unprecedented
turmoil in the Old World. Four great empires-the German Reich, the Austro-
Hungarian Empire, the Russian monarchy, and the Ottoman sultanate-
disappeared from history.
At a time when the world was in such upheaval, the Versailles Treaty was unable
to build a lasting peace. In the end, the United States never ratified the treaty
because the Senate, dominated by isolationist Republicans, wanted no part of
Wilson's League of Nations. Wilson entered the war promising to make the
world "safe for democracy," but the world order that emerged at Versailles was
neither democratic nor safe. Indeed, many historians believe that the humiliation
of Germany lead to the popular resentment against the Western powers that
Adolf Hitler would exploit in the 1930s to seize power.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. The treaty was signed in the famous Hall ofMirrors, which had been built by
Louis XIV at the Palace of Versailles outside Paris. The choice was highly
symbolic: It was the same room in which the French had capitulated to
Germany at the end of the Franco-Prussian war in 1871.
2. Chemical weapons were used for the first time in World War I, first by the
Germans in 1915 and then by the allies. Horrified by the slow death caused
bygas, European nations agreed in 1925 to ban the use ofchemical weapons on
the battlefield in future wars.
3. Woodrow Wilson won the Nobel Peace Price in 1920 for founding the League
of Nations. Two other US presidents-Teddy Roosevelt in 1906and jimmy
Carter in 2002-have won the award.
4. The treaty carved the old Austro-Hungarian empire up into several new
countries, in an effort to bring stability to central Europe. It didn't work out.
Two of the new countries-Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia-would not endure
the twentieth century.
TUESDAY, DAY 2
Waiting for Godot
En attendant Godot (1952)-in English, Waiting for Godot-is the best known
work of Irish-French author and playwright Samuel Beckett. As one of the first
pieces of absurdist theater, the play ushered in a new era of possibility for drama.
It divided critics sharply: Some considered it a brilliant articulation of the
monotony and meaninglessness of modern life, while others dismissed it as
tedious garbage. The former view certainly won out, as Beckett's 1969 Nobel
Prize cited Waiting for Godot as one of his greatest achievements.
Beckett was born in 1906 near Dublin. After studying Romance languages at
college, he traveled widely through Europe and settled in Paris. As a writer, he
dabbled in various genres, trying his hand at novels, short stories, poetry, and
essays. But it is for his plays that Beckett is most renowned-and among these,
Waitingfor Godot is undoubtedly the most famous.
Little occurs during the play. One evening, two men, Vladimir and Estragon, talk
and argue by the side of a road, waiting for someone named Godot. Before long,
a man passes by, leading his slave on a rope. The slave does a dance and delivers
a bizarre impromptu lecture. Later, a boy appears, telling the men that Godot is
delayed but that he will arrive the next day. Vladimir and Estragon return the
next evening and encounter the slave owner again; now inexplicably blind, he
has no recollection of having seen them the previous day. Later, the same boy
from the previous day arrives and states that Godot is not coming. Like the slave
owner, the boy has no recollection of having seen Vladimir and Estragon before.
The two men vow to leave and go home, but as the curtain falls, they continue to
wait.
Absurdist theater, like Godot, blossomed in Europe during the 1950s and 1960s.
Plays in this genre often seem meaningless or illogical, with vague, minimal
settings and strange dialogue rife with non sequiturs. Indeed, the setting of
Waiting for Godot is unknown, and the text never specifies who Godot is or why
the two men are waiting for him. Critics have taken the play to represent the
existential plight of the modern world, an exasperating stasis in which
humankind is waiting for something meaningful yet has no idea when or if this
thing will arrive-or even what it is.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Though Waiting for Godot may seem bizarre, many ofBeckett's works are far
more so. In Happy Days (1961), the female lead is buried in sand up to her
waist and later her neck. His two Act Without Words plays (1956) feature
mimes. Breath (1969) is just thirty-five seconds long.
2. Beckett hardly ever gave interviews or appeared publicly. When he won the
Nobel Prize in 1969, he accepted the award remotely rather than attend the
awards ceremony in Stockholm.
WEDNESDAY, DAY 3
The Scream
The Scream (1893), painted by the Norwegian expressionist Edvard Munch
(1863-1944), has become the modern icon of existential angst.
Munch painted The Scream for a larger series entitled The Frieze of Life-"a
poem of life, love and death." The work was meant to demonstrate contemporary
theories of synaesthesiathe idea that light and color impulses can produce the
impression of sound, and vice versa. Munch's first version of the painting
actually included an inscribed account of the experience that had inspired the
startling image: "I was out walking with two friends-the sun began to set-
suddenly the sky turned blood red-I paused, feeling exhausted, and leaned on the
fence-there was blood and tongues of fire above the blue-black fjord and the
city-my friends walked on, and I stood there trembling with anxiety-and I sensed
an infinite scream passing through nature."
The central figure, therefore, is Munch himself. The man is not screaming but
shielding his ears from the noise. Behind him is the Oslofjord, as viewed from
the hill of Ekeberg. The distorted perspective and lurid, swirling lines give visual
form to the inescapable sound of the scream.
Although Munch painted more than fifty versions of the painting, two are
particularly noteworthy. The first, done in gouache on cardboard, was stolen
from the Munch Museum in Oslo in 2004. The second, done in oil, tempera, and
pastel, is in the National Museum in Oslo. Munch also produced a lithograph of
the image in 1895.
ADDITIONAL FACT
1. A meteorological study conducted in 2003 suggested the source ofMunch's
inspiration was an unusually intense sunset caused by the eruption ofKrakatoa
in 1883.
THURSDAY, DAY 4
Sir Isaac Newton
Perhaps no person has contributed more to the fields of mathematics, physics,
and astronomy than Sir Isaac Newton (1642-1727). Regarded as the reigning
genius of his day, Newton was the first scientist ever to be knighted. His theories
on motion and gravity were unsurpassed for hundreds of years.
But Sir Isaac Newton's beginnings were not promising. Born on an English
manor January 4, 1643, three months before the death of his father, Newton was
so premature and small that his mother joked she could fit him inside a quart pot.
Newton miraculously survived infancy only to have his mother leave him at the
age of two. Raised by grandparents who never loved him, Newton performed
poorly in grammar school. His teachers described him as "idle" and
"inattentive." But since he showed no interest in the family business of farming,
his grandfather sent him to university.
At Cambridge, Newton studied Descartes, Boyle, Galileo, Kepler, Copernicus,
and Euclid. When the school closed in 1665 because of the plague, Newton
returned home with an educated, inspired mind. In the next two years, he began
to revolutionize math and science. He invented calculus concurrently with
Gottfried Wilhelm Leibnitz. Newton made advances in optics, proposing that
white light is actually a combination of all the different colors of visible light.
And perhaps most important, during this time Newton began to develop his three
laws of motion: an object in motion stays in motion until acted upon by an
outside force, the force acting on a body is directly proportional to its
acceleration, and for every action there is an equal but opposite reaction.
Newton's laws of motion were not made public until 1687, when he published
the Principia, which also included the law of universal gravitation: Every object
in the universe attracts every other object with a force proportional to the
product of the masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance
between them.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Newton's law ofgravity held up until Albert Einstein developed his theory
ofgeneral relativity in 1905.
2. Newton once threatened to burn down the house ofhis mother and stepfather.
He apologized for it later.
3. Newton and Leibnitz feuded for decades over who had really developed
calculus first.
4. Newton's later years were marred by mental instability. After his death, large
amounts of mercury were found in his body, probably due to his many fruitless
experiments in alchemy. The mercury may have accounted for his strange
behavior.
FRIDAY, DAY 1
Gustav Mahler
It wasn't until forty years after he died that the status of Gustav Mahler
(18601911) as a major composer was reestablished. Only after the
destructiveness of World War II did his work seem to matter to the general and
critical public.
Mahler was born into a broken home in Bohemia, the second of fourteen
children. His father was an abusive distiller, and even as a young boy, Mahler
sought solace in nature, taking long walks in the hills and fields around his
home. At fifteen, he was accepted into the Vienna Conservatory, where he
became fixated on the work of Ludwig van Beethoven and Richard Wagner.
Mahler adopted some of Wagner's life theories, including the practice of
vegetarianism. Sadly, for the rest of his life, some accused him of being a
second-rank imitator of Wagner and others.
Some critics saw Mahler's compositions as a strange patchwork of various
forms-strong symphonic movements a la Brahms or Beethoven, ringing choral
works, and precious, inconsequentialsounding folk songs, all within the same
works, as in his Symphony No. 9 (1909). Mahler's compositional techniques
were controversial while he was alive. He was also accused of using cheap
orchestral tricks to overwhelm the listener.
Mahler was, however, one of the first real superstar conductors, and his high
status was instrumental in developing the tradition of bestowing honor and
respect on orchestra directors. In 1907, he was made director of the New York
Metropolitan Opera and the next year started conducting the New York
Philharmonic. Mahler's compositions were neglected after his death, and they
only came to be popular again after years of support from other famous
conductors including Bruno Walter, Otto Klemperer, and Leonard Bernstein.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Mahler marriedAlma Schindler, who was probably the most fashionable
celebrity wife ofthe early twentieth century. After Mahler died, she wed the
architect Walter Gropius and then the writer Franz Werfel.
2. Mahler was superstitious about composers dying after their ninth symphony,
as Beethoven did. To avoid the curse, he composed The Song of the Earth, a
song cycle for tenor, soprano, and orchestra, immediately after his eighth
symphony, and a year later he wrote his actual ninth symphony. It didn't work.
Mahler died ofa throat infection shortly thereafter.
3. It seemed that every orchestra directed by Mahler, including the Vienna Opera
and the New York Philharmonic, gained world-class status after justa few years
under his direction.
SATURDAY, DAY 6
Phenomenology
Phenomenology is a school of philosophy founded by the German philosopher
Edmund Husserl (1859-1938). Husserl wanted to explore our conscious
experiences. (He put aside the question of what, if anything, existed beyond
them.) He understood phenomenology as the attempt to describe our conscious
experiences in a systematic way and believed that effort should form the basis of
philosophy.
One of Husserl's main aims was to study the intentionality of experience-in other
words, the fact that experiences are about things other than themselves. For
example, if one has the experience of being pursued by a lion-either because one
is having a nightmare of being pursued by a lion, or one is really being pursued
by a lion-one's experience is about a lion. By contrast, most things besides
experiences-for example, tables, rocks, or for that matter, lions themselves-are
not about anything else. Husserl took the intentionality of experiences to be the
main subject of phenomenology.
Husserl believed the goal of phenomenology was not merely a very detailed
description of some particular experience. He wished to define the necessary
structures and interrelations among different kinds of conscious experience.
Thus, phenomenology is distinct from psychology, which, according to Husserl,
merely describes how we think.
Many later philosophers were heavily influenced by phenomenology. For
instance, Husserl's student Martin Heidegger (1889-1976) incorporated many
phenomenological ideas into his philosophy. The French philosophers Jean-Paul
Sartre (1905-1980) and Maurice Merleau- Ponty (1908-1961) were also
influenced by Husserl's phenomenology.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Through its influence on HeideggerandSartre, phenontenologyplayeeldn
important role in the development ofexistentialism.
2. Husserl's term for a conscious experience that is intentionally directed at an
object is noesis. He calls the content of the act its "noema."
3. The term phenomenology comes from the Greek word for "to appear." In
contemporary philosophy, the term phenomenology is often used to describe
how something feels, or what an experience is like.
SUNDAY, DAY 7
Buddha/Gautama
Buddha, meaning the "enlightened one," was born in the sixth century BC as
Prince Siddhartha Gautama. His father was the chief of the Shakya tribe of
warriors in India.
According to some accounts, before Gautama was born, a seer appeared and
declared that Gautama would either be a great king or a great religious leader.
Gautama's father hoped that he would be a king and therefore attempted to
shelter him from religion and the suffering of the world. At around the age of
twenty-nine, however, Gautama ventured outside his father's protective walls
and witnessed the Four Sights, which forever changed his life. He saw an old
man, a sick man, a corpse, and a holy man or ascetic. After realizing that such
suffering existed in the world, as well as such faith, Gautama renounced his way
of life and retreated to Northeast India where he became a monk.
After meditating with the monks and trying several methods, such as fasting, to
achieve inner peace, Gautama was unsatisfied. It was then that he discovered the
"middle way" or "middle path" between self-indulgence, on the one hand, and
self-mortification, on the other. After Gautama began to meditate in this fashion,
he saw the truth.
Gautama believed that there were Four Noble Truths. First, there is suffering in
the world. Second, there is a cause of this suffering and that is desire. Third,
there is a state in which there is no suffering, called nirvana. And lastly, there is a
path to reach this state.
At first, Gautama was unsure if he should teach this revelation to others.
However, a spirit arrived and told him to do so. Gautama then began to preach
throughout the Ganges region in India. He claimed to be only one in a line of
Buddhas, whose job it was to teach others the path to enlightenment.
Gautama continued to preach the truth to others until his death, generally
believed to be at the age of eighty.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Many sources believe Gautama died from eating a batch ofpoisonous
mushrooms.
2. Besides Buddha, Gautama is also known as "Shakyamuni," or `Sage of the
Shakya Tribe" and "ThusCome-One."
3. Though Buddhism originated in India, by the thirteenth century it had
disappeared from the country almost completely after several foreign
conquests. By this time, however, ithad already spread to East Asia. Southeast
Asia, and the Himalayan region, where it remains today.
MONDAY, DAY I
Winston Churchill
Winston Churchill (1874-1965) was a British politician who led his country to
victory during World War II. Prior to the war, Churchill was widely considered a
failure. His career had been practically finished after he was blamed for British
missteps during World War I. He had served in the Cabinet in the 1920s, but by
the time Hitler took power in Germany, Churchill was warming a seat on the
backbenches, his warnings about Hitler's rise ignored by colleagues who thought
Churchill was an alarmist crank.
Britain turned to Churchill at one of the country's darkest hours. At the
beginning of the war, Neville Chamberlain, the leader of the Conservative
Party, was the prime minister. He resigned in 1940 when it became clear that he
was not up to the job of leading his country in a desperate war for survival.
Churchill replaced him at 10 Downing Street, the traditional residence of the
British prime minister.
The first months of World War II had been a disaster for the Allies. In 1939 and
early 1940, the German army invaded Poland, Denmark, Norway, Belgium, the
Netherlands, Luxembourg, and France. British forces sent to help defend France
were cornered by the Nazis and forced to evacuate the continent in 1940. With
the United States and Soviet Union neutral, Great Britain was the only major
military power left standing to oppose the onslaught of Nazi Germany.
As prime minister, however, Churchill achieved the impossible. For eighteen
months, Britain withstood the Nazis virtually by itself. The Soviet Union also
joined the war in 1941 after Hitler invaded Russia. In countless eloquent
speeches, Churchill rallied Britons and the citizens of occupied Europe to fight
the Nazis. The Allies stopped the Germans, and by D-Day in 1944 the tide had
turned decisively against the Nazi juggernaut.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. In addition to his political pursuits, Churchill was an accomplished journalist
and historian. After World WarII, he wrote a massive history ofthe conflict, The
Second World War, which helped him win the Nobel Prize in Literature in
1953.
2. Churchill was a successful war leader, but the domestic policies ofhis
Conservative Party were unpopular with voters. A few months after the defeat
of the Nazis in 1945, voters elected Clement Attlee, the leader of the
opposition Labor Party, to replace him.
3. In recognition of his wartime leadership, Churchill was made the first-ever
honorary citizen of the United States in 1963.
TUESDAY, DAY 2
Oscar Wilde
Irish playwright and essayist Oscar Wilde (1854-1900) was one of Western
literature's sharpest wits and certainly one of its most flamboyant personalities.
Though best known for mercilessly exposing the hypocrisies of Victorian
society, he also made significant contributions to the philosophy of art and
aesthetics. His colorful personal life, meanwhile, was just as fascinating as his
works, and his eccentricities made him a celebrity during his day.
Born in Dublin to well-educated parents, Wilde studied at Trinity College and at
Oxford, specializing in classics and poetry. At school, he quickly made a name
for himself as a writer and also adopted the affected demeanor and showy dress
that would become his trademark. From his earliest college days, Wilde was
fascinated by the concept of art itself: what it is, why it is important, and what its
role should be in life and society. Wilde came to identify with the Aesthetic
movement that swept Europe in the late 1800s, believing strongly in the concept
of "art for art's sake"-the idea that art needed no justification or concrete purpose
whatsoever.
Wilde wrote most of his major works during a burst of productivity in the 1890s.
The first among these was a novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray (1890), in which
the portrait of a vain young man transforms over time to reflect the man's
corruption and advancing age. More famous are Wilde's plays-drawing-room
comedies whose barbed wit eviscerates the attitudes and habits of affluent
British society. Lady Windermere's Fan (1892) concerns a woman who
blackmails her son-in-law; An Ideal Husband (1895) portrays a similar
blackmail of a public official.
Wilde's masterpiece is undoubtedly The Importance ofBeingEarnest (1895), a
mistaken-identity caper involving two slippery young men, two young women,
and a hilariously condescending noblewoman. Typical of Wilde's work, the play
is riddled with secrets and misunderstandings and skewers its targets with smart
satire rather than open mockery or insult. Its characters are prodigiously
quotable, uttering a near-constant stream of epigrams that are both witty and
substantive.
Wilde's meteoric rise to success during the 1890s was followed by just as
precipitous a crash. Though Wilde was married and had children, he was openly
homosexual and in 1895 was put on trial for having an "indecent" relationship
with a nobleman's son. After serving a sentence of two years' hard labor, which
weakened his health considerably, Wilde died, virtually penniless, in 1900.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. After am uchpublicized lecture tour through the United States in 1882, Wilde
concluded that, America is the only country that went from barbarism to
decadence without civilization in between."
2. Upon arriving in New York for the start of this lecture tour, Wilde told US
customs officials that he had nothing to declare, "only my genius."
WEDNESDAY, DAY 3
Henri Matisse
Henri Matisse (1869-1954) was one of the founding fathers of fauvism, a
movement that opposed naturalism and celebrated the beauty and psychological
power of color. He is particularly known for his murals of dancing figures and
for the huge paper cutouts that he did at the end of his career.
Matisse was born in Picardy, France, in 1869. The child of comfortable, middle-
class parents, he earned a law degree in 1889. Having had no prior experience in
art, Matisse discovered his talent for drawing while recovering from an attack of
appendicitis. Determined to pursue a career in painting, he moved to Paris and
enrolled at the Academic Julian where he studied under the academic painter
William-Adolphe Bouguereau. The following year, Matisse was invited to join
the studio of the symbolist Gustave Moreau and also entered the Ecole des
Beaux-Arts, where he learned to paint by copying old masters.
After a brief stay in Corsica in the late 1890s, Matisse returned to Paris where he
led of a group of younger artists who wished to break with older traditions. In
1905, the group caused a great stir with their radically different paintings at the
Salon d'Automne. A critic who objected to their use of bright colors and
childlike compositions called them fauves, or savage beasts. A painting typical
of this period in Matisse's career is Le Bonheur de vivre (1906), which depicts
female nudes dancing and playing music in a simple landscape. Explaining his
objective, Matisse declared, "Composition is the art of arranging in a decorative
manner the various elements at a painter's disposal for the expression of his
feeling." In many respects Matisse's goal was identical to that of the
expressionists, but he disapproved of their tendency to dwell on negative
emotions. He wanted his art to induce pleasure and be "something like a good
armchair in which to rest from physical fatigue."
In the 1920s, Matisse moved to Nice on the Riviera, where he spent most of the
rest of his life. In 1930, he sailed to Tahiti via the United States, where he
received a commission from the Barnes Foundation in Pennsylvania for the
mural Dance. In the 1930s Matisse devoted himself to book illustration,
supplying etchings for editions of Stephane Mallarme's Poesies and James
Joyce's Ulysses. In 1944, Matisse was asked to produce an illustrated album with
his reflections on jazz, He decorated it with paper cutouts that he made by
"drawing with scissors."
After an operation for an eye tumor in 1941, Matisse turned increasingly to
drawing and paper cutouts. He continued to work until 1951. Among his last
works were the windows, murals, and other decorations for the Chapelle du
Rosaire in the southern French town of Vence. The huge paper cutouts he did in
the early 1950s demonstrate that he remained a revolutionary artist even in his
old age.
ADDITIONAL FACT
1. In 1920, Matisse designed the costumes and settings for Sergey Diaghilev's
production ofIgor Stravinsky opera, Le Chant de Rossignol.
THURSDAY, DAY 4
The Real Numbers
The real numbers are the numbers that you are likely to encounter in day-to-day
life. The set of real numbers consists of all the numbers that can be represented
on the number line. It encompasses natural numbers, whole numbers, integers,
rational numbers, and irrational numbers.
Natural numbers are the counting numbers, starting with the number 1. They are
the oldest numbers known to man. One can imagine a caveman discovering the
natural numbers on his fingers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ...). Many cultures in the early
history of man also invented the concept of zero. Zero is not a natural number,
but rather a whole number. The set of whole numbers begins (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ...).
As math became more sophisticated, people began to ask what would happen if
you subtracted a large number from a small number. The idea of negative
numbers came into being, but for many years mathematicians were unwilling to
accept negative numbers as solutions to equations. Still, without negative
numbers, it would be impossible to figure out debt. The set of all the whole
negative and whole positive numbers is called the integer set.
After integers comes the concept of fractions, or rational numbers. All rational
numbers can be written as ratios of integers such as 5/3 or 1/8 or -5/3. All
integers are rational numbers, too.
The Pythagoreans, an ancient Greek cult that worshiped numbers, were shocked
and horrified to discover some numbers that could not be expressed as the ratios
of integers, such as n and V2. But these numbers definitely exist, and they can be
used to solve problems like finding the circumference of a circle and the length
of a triangle's hypotenuse. They are called irrational numbers. Decimal
representations of irrational numbers will go on forever without repeating in a
pattern.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Negative numbers were invented by Indian mathematicians around 600 AD,
but they were not adopted in Europe until the 1600s.
2. The Egyptians started using fractions around 1000 BC.
FRIDAY, DAY 5
Impressionists Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel
The impressionists of the visual arts tried to depict not an object or scene but to
give a mere suggestion of representation. The music of Claude Debussy
(18621918) and Maurice Ravel (1875-1938) was similarly different from the
tradition of "programmatic" music that goes back to the baroque. Rather than
directly represent a scene or idea, their music strove to evoke it more indirectly.
In addition, Debussy and, to a lesser extent, Ravel, avoided the formal structures
that had marked much German music up to this time.
Claude Debussy was born outside of Paris and entered the conservatory there
when he was eleven. After winning a scholarship to study in Rome, Debussy
returned to his hometown and indulged in an utterly Bohemian lifestyle centered
in the fashionable neighborhood of Montmartre. He socialized with artists,
writers, and other musicians, eventually attending the meetings of a group
known as the symbolists, which included the poets Charles Baudelaire, Paul
Verlaine, Arthur Rimbaud, and Stephane Mallarme. Their theory of poetry
involved the suggestion of an object or an idea using words that allude to it,
rather than the name of the thing itself.
Debussy translated this idea into music, and he sometimes even used symbolist
texts. His works are almost always described with words like lush, rich, and
intoxicating. Even though Debussy used new, revolutionary harmonies in works
like Claire de Lune (1890) and Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun (1894), his
beautiful music has always been more accessible to listeners than revolutionary
music often is.
The other great impressionist was Maurice Ravel, who, like Debussy, studied at
the Paris Conservatory and lived among hipsters in Paris. His group was called
"The Apaches," which comes from a French word for "street thug." Ravel's most
famous works include the evocative Rhapsodic Espagnole (1908) and his
miniature ballet piece Bolero (1928), an entrancing composition that is basically
one long, slow crescendo over a repeated rhythm motive.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Debussy's teacher Ernest Guirand once told him, "Ins not saying that what you
do isn't beautiful, but its theoretically absurd. "
2. Ravel studied at conservatory with the famed composer Gabriel Faure.
3. Debussy accused Ravel ofplagiarism many times, suggesting that the younger
composer's string quartet was too imitative ofhis own work. These accusations
would permanently sour their relationship.
SATURDAY, DAY 6
Martin Heidegger
Born in Messkirch, Germany, Martin Heidegger (1889-1976) originally planned
to become a Catholic priest. He became a philosopher instead, eventually
leaving the church entirely. While a student at the University of Freiburg, he
began following Edmund Husserl (1859-1938), the founder of phenomenology.
From 1933 to 1934, Heidegger was elected rector of the University of Freiburg,
and he joined the Nazi party. Although Husserl and many of Heidegger's other
colleagues were Jewish, Heidegger never apologized for his involvements with
Nazism. The relationship between his philosophy and Nazism has been
controversial ever since.
Heidegger's thinking evolved over his life, but his central focus always remained
what he called the "question of being"-What is being? What is it to be?
According to Heidegger, this was the fundamental question of metaphysics that
had been forgotten. Philosophers, argued Heidegger, have confused being with
"beings," like humans or even God. Against, this tendency, Heidegger
emphasized the difference between beingwhat it is to be and beings-particular
entities that are.
Heidegger first discussed this view in his most famous work, Being and Time
(1927). In it, Heidegger investigated the question of being by investigating the
one being that understands being-humans. In later works, Heidegger tended to
de-emphasize the analysis of human existence and consider being directly. He
also became increasingly interested in what he called "technology." He did not
mean computers and machines, but rather a way of understanding the world in
which we consider it a resource for our own disposal. Heidegger was highly
critical of this attitude.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. In his later writings, Heidegger described what he was doing as "thinking"
rather than philosophy. He described thinking as more closely related to poetry.
2. Heidegger's writings on "technology" were an early influence on the
environmental movement.
3. Despite being married, Heidegger had d love affair with a young Hanah
Arendt (1906-1975), at the time a student ofhis, but who eventually became an
important philosopher in her own right. Arendt was Jewish, and she was
particularly disappointed by Heidegger's involvement with Nazism in the
1930s.
SUNDAY, DAY 7
Four Noble Truths and Eightfold Path
At the heart of Buddha's enlightenment were the Four Noble Truths. These were
the first teachings that he spoke of to his fellow monks after his enlightenment.
The first truth was that, contrary to his sheltered childhood, there was suffering
in the world. The second truth was that this suffering had a cause and that this
cause was desire. The third truth was that a state of being existed called nirvana,
in which there was no suffering. Additionally, the way to achieve this state was
to eliminate desire. The fourth and final truth was that a path exists that can lead
away from desire and to nirvana, and this path is the Eightfold Path.
The Eightfold Path is the following set of rules that one must follow in order to
achieve nirvana and enlightenment:
Right view calls for knowledge of the Four Noble Truths and to remain
free of prejudice and delusion
Right thought means to avoid ill will.
Right speech tells us not to lie.
Right action asks that we be peaceful and not, for example, steal or kill.
Right livelihood means to earn a living in an honest way.
Right effort says that we should continuously strive to overcome the
ignorance of others and our own desires.
Right mindfulness asks that we remain aware of our feelings and mental
state.
Right concentration suggests that we focus on the "Buddhahood" in all
beings.
The Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path are the core of Bhuddism's
teachings. The truths can be viewed as the basic belief system, and the path as a
guide to practicing the faith.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. After becoming disillusioned with what the Hindu gods and goddesses failed
to provide for the suffering of humanity, Buddha turned to this deity free
doctrine and discipline.
2. Although Jesus Christ is often credited with being the first to emphasize
proper thoughts-in the Sermon on the Mounthe claimed that thinking ofmurder
was justas bad as committing it-Buddha made similar claims with his concept
ofright thought, 500 years earlier.
MONDAY, DAY I
The Spanish Civil War
The Spanish Civil War was a bloody conflict that lasted from 1936 until 1939,
killing hundreds of thousands of soldiers and civilians. Both sides in the war-
left-wing socialists loyal to the government and the eventually victorious
nationalist rebels under the command of General Francisco Francocommitted
acts of terrible brutality. Estimates of the death toll range as high as one million.
In its ferocity, the Spanish Civil War was a grim preview of World War II.
Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany both sided with Franco, and both Axis powers
used Spain as a laboratory to test the weapons and tactics they would soon inflict
on the rest of Europe. In 1937, the German air force bombed the Spanish town of
Guernica, killing hundreds of civilians and inspiring Pablo Picasso's famous
antiwar painting Guernica.
While Germany and Italy aided Franco's rebels, the Soviet Union supplied arms
to the loyalists. Preserving the elected Spanish government became a romantic
cause celebre among communists and left-leaning Western intellectuals. Many
Americans and Europeans volunteered for the loyalist army. Famous writers,
including George Orwell and Ernest Hemingway, flocked to Spain.
After his troops finally captured Madrid from the loyalists in March, 1939,
General Franco ruled Spain as a fascist dictator until his death in 1975.
In the West-especially among intellectuals-the atrocities of the Spanish Civil War
hardened opposition to fascism, weakened isolationism, and lead many to
conclude that the West would eventually have to confront the Axis militarily. At
the same time, many left-wing writers became disillusioned with the Soviet
Union after witnessing its self-interested and ultimately ineffective support for
loyalist Spain.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. ErnestHemingway's novel For Whom the Bell Tolls, about an American
volunteer for loyalist Spain, was based on his experience in Spain during the
war.
2. Rick Blaine, Humphrey Bogart's cynical character in the movie Casablanca,
had illegally supplied arms to loyalist Spain before moving to Africa.
3. Despite the crucial help he received from Hitler and Mussolini in the Civil
War, Franco decided to remain neutral during World War H.
TUESDAY, DAY 2
Metafiction
Writers in both academia and popular culture throw around the word meta with
alarming frequency. Either standing alone or used as a prefix, it has become the
intellectual word du jour and has thus entered the realm of reckless overuse. But
the term's recent trendiness belies the fact that the literary genre of metafiction is
concrete and well established-and arguably one of the most fascinating and
fruitful arenas of twentieth-century literature.
From the Greek prefix meta, meaning "after" or "beyond," metafiction refers to
fiction that is about fiction itselfits creation, devices, and outcomes. Many works
of metafiction revisit previous fictional works from new perspectives,
introducing new themes and shedding new light on existing material. Others
focus on the process ofwriting, illuminating the relationship between the author
and the text that he or she creates. As a result, metafiction tends by its nature to
be self-referential and ironic, calling attention to its own artifice and unreality.
James Joyce's novel Ulysses (1922), arguably the first major work of twentieth-
century metafiction, recasts the hero of Homer's Odyssey in the guise of an ad
salesman in 1904 Dublin. In doing so, the novel investigates the definition of
heroism in the modern world. Meanwhile, by tinkering with genres and language
in the novel's various chapters, Joyce also explores the authorial process and the
relationship between form and content.
Many postmodern authors followed Joyce's lead in reimagining older works.
Jean Rhys's Wide Sargasso Sea (1966) tells the backstory of Bertha Mason, the
Creole madwoman locked in the attic in Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre. John
Gardner's Grendel (1971) retells the Anglo-Saxon epic Beowulf from the
perspective of the monster, recasting Grendel as a lonely, philosophical creature
who is arguably more human than Beowulf. Tom Stoppard's Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern Are Dead (1967) delves into the lives of two minor characters in
Shakespeare's Hamlet.
Other works of metafiction focus on the processes of writing and reading fiction.
Milan Kundera's Immortality (1990) inserts the author as a character in his own
work, commenting on his creation. Michael Cunningham's The Hours (1998)
explores Virginia Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway through three different stories,
depicting Woolf herself writing the novel in 1923, a housewife reading the novel
in 1949 Los Angeles, and a woman unwittingly reliving the events of the novel
in New York in the late 1990s.
ADDITIONAL FACT
1. Metafiction arguably began as early as Miguel de Cervantes's Don Quixote, in
which the main characters are aware of both Cervantes's account of their
adventures and a fake sequel that another author published.
WEDNESDAY, DAY 3
Guggenheim Museum
New York's Guggenheim Museum is one of the most revolutionary structures of
the twentieth century. Conceived as a huge, enclosed spiral ramp, it broke
completely with earlier museum designs.
The museum was built by American architect Frank Lloyd Wright (1867-1959)
to house the modern art collection of the Solomon R. Guggenheim foundation.
In 1943, Guggenheim, who had already established a Museum for Non-
Objective Painting, commissioned a permanent home for his art. He left the
choice of architect to his artistic consultant, the Baroness Hilla von Rebay. She,
in turn, turned to Wright, who had already earned fame for his many innovative
structures, most notably "Fallingwater," a house built over a waterfall in Bear
Run, Pennsylvania. In her letter to Wright, von Rebay proclaimed, "I need a
fighter, a lover of space, an agitator, a tester, and a wise man ... I want a temple
of spirit, a monument!"
In 1951, the foundation bought a large lot on Fifth Avenue between Eighty-
eighth and Eightyninth streets in New York City. The museum was completed in
1959. A ten-story tower was added in 1991 to accommodate the expanding
collection.
In the Guggenheim, Wright fused the geometry of modern architecture with
natural organic forms. The structure has been compared to a nautilus shell and to
an inverted ziggurat-a Mesopotamian spiral-shaped temple. The concrete, spiral
ramp that wraps around the ninetyfoot tall atrium dominates the interior.
Although the main exhibition space lies alongside the ramp, separate galleries
branch off from the main artery on each floor. Sunlight filters in through the
glass ceiling. Viewers generally take an elevator to the top floor and view the
artworks on their descent.
When the building opened to the public in 1959, it received both great praise and
sharp criticism. Some people felt that Wright had wasted the view of Central
Park across the street by designing an enclosed spiral. Others felt that the ramp
made it difficult to look at large pictures from a distance, and that its slope
created a sense of instability. Although Wright claimed that the natural light
from the glass dome would be sufficient to illuminate the interior, the museum
proved to be too dark for comfortable viewing and artificial lighting had to be
installed.
Despite the museum's problems as an exhibition space, it continues to be one of
the most popular tourist attractions in New York, welcoming thousands of
visitors every week.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. The Guggenheim Museum is located on the Upper East Side of New York
City, on what is known as `Museum Mile." There are five museums between
82nd Street and 105th Street on Fifth Avenue.
2. Branches of the Guggenheim Museum now exist in Venice, Bilbao, Berlin,
and Las Vegas. Plans for an additional Guggenheim in New York (designed by
Frank Gehry) and new ones in Rio de Janeiro and Tokyo are in the works.
THURSDAY, DAY 4
Prime Numbers
A prime number is a whole number greater than one that can only be evenly
divided by one and itself.
Two is the smallest prime number, and the only even prime number. Three, five,
and seven are also prime numbers, but so are 89; 2,521; and 1,299,007. The
fundamental theorem of arithmetic states that every whole number greater than
one can be written as a product of prime numbers. In this way, prime numbers
are the building blocks of all positive numbers. For example, 209,328 can also
be written as a product of its prime factors: 209,328 = 2" x 3 x 72 x 89. All
numbers that are the product of two or more prime numbers are called composite
numbers. Six is a composite number (2 x 3) and so is 209,328.
There are infinitely many prime numbers. Euclid of Alexandria first proved this
fact in the third century BC. His proof is simple and elegant. He asked us to
suppose the opposite: that there is a finite set ofprime numbers. Multiply all of
those numbers together: 2 x 3 x 5 x 7 ... x the largest number in the set, and add
one. If you divide the new number by any prime number, you will always have a
remainder of one. Adding one created a new prime number. Thus, there are
always more prime numbers to be found.
The search for patterns in prime numbers is one of greatest challenges in
mathematics today. Mathematicians still have not devised one all-encompassing
formula that can generate all the prime numbers, although they are finding larger
and larger prime numbers all the time.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. The largest known prime as ofDecember 2005 is 230402° '1. It is 9,152, 052
digits long.
2. There are many questions about primes that remain open. For example, are
there an infinite number of twin primes, prime numbers with a difference of
two, such as 3 and 5, 101 and 103, and 2141 and 2143? No one knows.
3. In the movie Contact, the aliens that contact Jodi Foster's character transmit a
list ofprime numbers, indicating their intelligence and understanding of
mathematics as the universal language.
FRIDAY, DAY 5
Tonality and Atonality
All music from the seventeenth to the early twentieth centuries generally falls
into the category of tonal music. Tonal music is based on the idea that in each
piece of music, one of the twelve tones of Western music (C-C#-D-D#-E-F-F#-
G-G#-A-A#-B) is given more importance than the rest and is used as a reference
point. This one special tone is called the tonal center, or the tonic note, and it is
audible in most music as the "center" of a piece.
This concept is reflected in the names of classical works. If a piece is called
Symphony in Gminor, it is probably based on the G-minor scale, with Gas its
tonal center.
Richard Wagner was one composer who began to change music with the
extensive use of chromaticism. He composed pieces that made use of tones in
between the set pitches of a scale. For example, if writing in C-major, which is
based on the C-major scale of C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C, Wagner might use the tones
C#, D#, F#, G#, and A# extensively.
After Wagner, composers began to push the envelope of tonality even further.
The result is atonality, in which each of the twelve pitches is given equal weight,
and music is not based on a tonal center. Not all melodies have to move toward
any certain tonal center. Atonal composers say that the elimination of the tonic
opens up new doors of expression the same way abstract expressionism opened
up new worlds of possibility for the visual arts.
This may all seem technical, but tonality encompasses most music that is
familiar and pleasing to the human ear. Almost all pop and folk music falls
within the limits of tonal music. When this convention is challenged, be it in
classical, jazz, or pop music, the result sounds harsh and unfamiliar to most
people's ears. Even today, nearly a hundred years after its inception, atonal music
sounds startling and "modern"
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. A notable piece of early atonal music was Arnold Schoenberg's Pierrot
Lunaire (1914).
2. Many composers, such as Charles Ives and Igor Stravinsky, experimented
with polytonality, or the practice ofhaving more than one tonal center
simultaneously in a piece ofmusic.
3. The rejection of tonality in music philosophically and chronologically
coincided with the rejection of a tangible subject in abstract art.
SATURDAY, DAY 6
Aesthetics
Aesthetics is the philosophy of art.
The first important question is: What is art? An ordinary kitchen table is
presumably not a work of art, but the Mona Lisa is. Philosophers call this the
problem of the ontology of art What it is about an object that makes it art?
One possible answer is that art is beautiful. But not all beautiful things are art.
Sunsets, landscapes, and certain people are beautiful, but are not works ofart.
Another possible answer is that art represents something, or conveys a message.
However, the footage from a security camera represents something-namely, the
people it records-but that footage is not art. Likewise, sentences of English
convey a message, but that does not mean that all sentences of English are
artworks, though some may be.
Another important question in philosophical aesthetics is: What are we saying
when we evaluate art? If we say of some painting "This is beautiful," or "This is
good art," are we just saying that we like the painting, or that it pleases us? If so,
one observer may say a painting is beautiful, while another says it is ugly
without disagreeing. All the first statement means is that the painting pleased the
first observer, while all the second statement means is that it did not please the
second observer. Neither statement alleges any general truth about the painting.
The difficulty with this approach is that it appears to leave no room for arguing,
or reasoning, about the value of art. It also leaves no room for the concept of
taste, the idea that some people are better able than others to determine what is
good art, and why.
Other questions in aesthetics include: What is a genre? What makes something a
novel, rather than a long poem? Aestheticians also consider: What is the purpose
of art? What is valuable about art, and why should we care about it?
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. The word aesthetics was coined by the little-known German philosopher
Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten (1714-1762). It comes from the Greek,
meaning perception, or sensation.
2. Plato (429-347BC) believed that artists were twice-removed from reality
because they produced imitations of ordinary objects such as tables and beds,
which were merely imitations of the ideal forms.
SUNDAY, DAY 7
Zen
Zen Buddhism, which has been known as a religion, a philosophy, a way of life,
and an art form, began with a man named Bodhidharma in 520 AD. According
to believers, Bodhidharma traveled from India to the Chinese kingdom of
Luoyang. In Luoyang, Bodhidharma went before the Emperor Wu and declared
that self-interest was worthless. He then proceeded to a monastery where he sat
and meditated before a wall for nine years before accepting students.
Zen, meaning meditation, emphasizes the importance of meditating in order to
calm or free one's mind so that one can eventually achieve nirvana. The most
common type of Zen is Zazen, or sitting meditation, often done while posed in
the lotus position. Zen Buddhists especially advocate group meditation.
An offshoot of Buddhism, Zen has been greatly influenced by both Taoism and
Confucianism in China. What makes it most distinct from other forms of
Buddhism, however, is its treatment of texts and its teachers. Zen deemphasizes
the study of ancient Buddhist texts believing the practice of meditation to be far
more important than study.
Further, Zen places an enormous emphasis on the lineage of its teachers.
Beginning with Bodhidharma and his disciples, a direct line of wisdom was
established. Tracing an instructor's teaching heritage is essential to his level of
prestige.
After its arrival in China, Zen Buddhism spread to Japan, Korea, and Vietnam.
However, over the past 1,500 years, each branch has broken off so that Japanese
Zen, is no longer the same as its Chinese ancestor nor its Korean and Vietnamese
cousins.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Another type of meditation called Kinhin, or walking Zazen, calls for a group
of people to meditate while walking around a room clockwise, their right
shoulders always facing the center.
2. The original Sanskrit word for meditation was transliterated in China as
"Chan." "Chan" later became Zen"in Japan, "Sean" in Korea, and "Thien" in
Vietnam.
MONDAY, DAY I
Adolf Hitler
Adolf Hitler (1889-1945) was the dictator of Germany, whose 1939 invasion of
Poland sparked the beginning of World War II. The war eventually spread to
almost every corner of the globe, leading to fifty million deaths along with
untold destruction and human misery. Despite help from Hitler's axis partners,
Japan and Italy, the tide turned against Germany by 1943. In 1945, Hitler
committed suicide with a bullet to the head as victorious Allied troops
approached his underground bunker in downtown Berlin.
Unlike many dictators, Hitler had enjoyed widespread public support during his
reign. In fact, his Nazi Party fared well in Germany's last democratic elections in
the early 1930s. Hitler was a mesmerizing speaker, and his charisma convinced
many Germans that the Nazis could reverse the nation's decline after its
humiliating defeat in World War I. After Germany's surrender, however, most of
Hitler's countrymen quickly disavowed the fuhrer who had led their country to
ruin.
Hitler was born in Austria, then a German-speaking province of the Austro-
Hungarian Empire. He aspired to be a painter, but art schools in Vienna turned
him away. He moved to Germany and fought in World War I, suffering minor
injuries. Prior to the war, Hitler had no strong political beliefs. But after
Germany's defeat, he embraced the popular theory that a Jewish conspiracy was
somehow secretly responsible for the nation's humiliation. He joined a then-
obscure anti-Semitic political party, the National Socialists, and soon became its
leader.
Though anti-Semitism was widespread in Germany before and after World War
I, it was the personality of Hitler himself that attracted many Germans to the
Nazi Party. Albert Speer, an architect who became the head of wartime
Germany's arms factories, described feeling a "wave of enthusiasm which ... One
could almost feel" the first time he heard Hitler speak. "... it swept away any
skepticism, any reservations."
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. After his suicide, invading Soviet forces seized Hitler's corpse. His skull
remains in a government building in Moscow.
2. The Nazis attracted many supporters, even in the Western countries that would
oppose Germany in World War H. Before the war, Hitler's admirers in the
United States included famedpilot Charles Lindbergh and automaker Henry
Ford.
3. Hitler hoped to prove his theory of German racial superiority at the 1936
Olympics, which were held in Berlin. But a black American sprinter, Jesse
Owens, dashed those hopes by winning four gold medals, one of the most
famous triumphs in Olympic history.
TUESDAY, DAY 2
"This Is My Letter to the World"
Though she remained a virtual unknown during her lifetime, since her death,
Emily Dickinson (1830-1886) has been acknowledged as one of America's
greatest poets. Her short, epigrammatic poems, revolutionary in both style and
technique, illuminate a vast inner life.
Dickinson was born and raised in her family's hometown of Amherst,
Massachusetts. After finishing her secondary education in the late 1840s, she
made her first forays into writing poetry. Her early works are more
conventional, utilizing meter from ballads, hymns, and other traditional forms.
By the 1860s, however, Dickinson had begun to twist these established forms,
experimenting boldly with rhythm, rhyme, word choice, and punctuation. The
result was a body of poems that create tension between the familiar and the
unexpected and that have an unmistakable look on the printed page.
"This Is My Letter to the World" (c. 1862) typifies Dickinson's style, form, and
voice. Like all of her poems, it is untitled, known simply by its first line.
Composed of two four-line stanzas, or quatrains, it is written in rhymed iambic
tetrameter and trimeter lines, alternating with each othera standard ballad form
in which each line consists of six or eight syllables in an unstressed-stressed
pattern. But Dickinson played with this standard form: In the first line, she
begas not with an iambic foot but with its opposite, a trochaic foot (stressed-
unstressed), which emphasizes the word "This." Typical of her style, she
interspersed the poem with dashes that break up the flow of the lines and lend
prominence to certain words.
The poem exemplifies the introspective themes of Dickinson's work-in this
case, artistic creativity. She revealed her insecurity about releasing the product
of her creative energies out into the world, the gamble inherent in committing
the "Message" of her works to "Hands [she] cannot see." In the last line, "Judge
tenderly-of Me," she encapsulated the anxiety of probably every artist or writer
who has ever walked the earth.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Ofthe more than 1,700 poems that Dickinson wrote, only seven were
published during her lifetime.
2. Dickinson was also a prolific writer of letters, producing hundreds that have
largely survived preserved. Scholars value this correspondence highly, for its
language is often just as rich as in Dickinson's poetry.
3. During the last two decades of her life, Dickinson never left the boundaries
of her family's property in Amherst.
WEDNESDAY, DAY 3
Cubism
Cubism was perhaps the most important art movement of the early twentieth
century. It reduced the shapes ofpeople and things to basic geometric forms and
rejected the rules of mathematical perspective. In doing so, it challenged the way
a spectator understood space and volume on a two-dimensional surface.
The origins of cubism can be traced to the later works of Paul Cezanne, who
gave hard, angular contours to natural forms and depicted them from different
viewpoints simultaneously. In 1907, Pablo Picasso expanded on Cezanne's
approach in Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, a painting of four prostitutes in a
brothel addressing a male viewer outside the picture. The women have
geometricized bodies that complement the sharp angles in the background
behind them. The shadows fall arbitrarily, and the women's bodies do not
diminish regularly in the distance. By making the foreground collapse into
background, Picasso makes the viewer fully conscious of the picture's flatness.
Joined by fellow artist Georges Braque, Picasso developed the principles of
cubism further. The name of the movement was coined by Henri Matisse, who
told art critic Louis Vauxcelles that Braque created art "with little cubes."
Vauxcelles, in turn, referred to Braque's works as bizarreries cubiques, "cubic
oddities."
The first phase of cubism, from around 1908 to 1912, is called analytical cubism.
At this stage, the two artists were concerned primarily with breaking down forms
by playing with the rules of perspective, painting arbitrary shadows and
eliminating nearly all color. Although the images seem abstract, they still relate
to something in nature, generally a human figure or a still life. A typical
composition of this period is Braque's The Portuguese (1911).
Circa 1912, Braque began gluing bits of newsprint and wallpaper onto his
canvases. Thus a second phase of the movement-synthetic cubism-evolved, in
which synthetic materials were added to paintings. For example, in Picasso's
Still Life with Chair Caning (1911-12), a piece of oilcloth imprinted with the
pattern of chair caning serves as the ground of the painting, and a real rope
frames the entire composition.
By the beginning of World War I, the cubism movement was essentially over,
but its radical rejection of traditional principles ofpainting was an inspiration to
all subsequent modern artists.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Later forms ofcubism include cubo futurism, purism, Orphism,
andprecisionism.
2. American artists Stuart Davis andAaron Douglas were both strongly
influenced by cubism.
3. Braque and Picasso painted the same motifs over and over again during their
cubist period. Most common among them were musical instruments, bottles,
pitchers, glasses, newspapers, and block letters.
THURSDAY, DAY 4
Pi
The diameter of a circle is the distance from one side of the circle to the other,
going straight through the middle. The circumference of a circle is the distance
all the way around the outside edge of the circle. The relationship between the
diameter and the circumference never changes. No matter what the size of the
circle-whether it is a poker chip or the equator of the earth-the diameter fits into
the circumference 3.14 times. But 3.14 is just an approximation. The real
number is called n, or pi.
Pi is an extremely useful number. If you know the distance across a circle, or
even half the distance (the radius, r), you can use pi to determine the
circumference without measuring the distance all the way around. It can also
help you find the area of a circle (area = nr2) and solve most geometric problems
involving circles, spheres, and arcs. But pi is also useful outside of geometry. It
factors into Werner Heinsenberg's uncertainty principle, Albert Einstein's field
equation of general relativity, Charles-Augustin de Coulomb's law for the
electric force, and many other facets of physics, statistics, and number theory.
Pi is also fascinating because even though it is a very simple concept, no one can
calculate it exactly. Pi is sometimes written 3.14159265.. . because there is no
end to pi. The numbers after the decimal point will go on forever without
repeating. It is called an irrational number, a number that cannot be expressed as
the ratio of two integers. The ancient Babylonians and Egyptians were aware
ofpi and tried to approximate it, which is precisely what we are still trying to do.
They calculated it to be 3.125 (Babylonians) and 3.16 (Egyptians), which aren't
bad estimates. Today's supercomputers, which can carry out 2 trillion operations
per second, have accurately ascertained the first 1,241,100,000,000 digits ofpi.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Archimedes of Syracuse (287-212 BC) used an early form of calculus to
obtain a very accurate estimation of pi. He said that it was between 223/71 and
22/7 An average of his two bounds is 3.1418, a close estimate.
2. German mathematician Ludolph van Ceulen (circa 1600) accurately
calculated the first thirty-five digits ofpi. He was so proud, he had them
engraved on his tombstone.
3. Piphilology is afield ofstudy devoted to creating mnemonic devices to
remember the digits ofpi.
4. On July 2, 2005, a fifty-nine year-old Japanese mental health counselor
successfully recited the first 83,431 decimals ofpi.
FRIDAY, DAY 5
The Second Viennese School
Modernist composer Arnold Schoenberg (1874-1951) and his two pupils Alban
Berg (1885-1935) and Anton Webern (1883-1945) are referred to as the Second
Viennese School because their composing lives centered on Vienna, as did the
Classical Viennese masters of the eighteenth century: Franz Joseph Haydn,
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and Ludwig van Beethoven. They introduced
concerts of atonal and twelve-tone serial works to the musical world, sending it
into uproar and disarray.
Schoenberg was raised an Orthodox Jew in anti-Semitic Austria, struggling to
get by as a music transcriber when his father died. He became a professor of
composition at the Stern Conservatory in Berlin in 1901, and in 1904 he took on
Berg and Webern as students. Schoenberg's early music imitates the
chromaticism of Richard Wagner, but it slowly drifted away from tonal systems
between 1905 and 1907. Two works written in 1912, Pierrot Lunaire and Five
Pieces for Orchestra, shocked the world awake with their embrace of atonality,
and a new era of composition was born. Both pieces were initially criticized for
their apparent lack of logical organization, and in response Schoenberg
articulated a rational system for atonality: twelve-tone serialism.
Berg and Webern developed their master's technique. Webern applied serialism
to dynamic changes and rhythm as well as pitches, creating something called
total serialism. Webern was also known for uniting modernism and romanticism
by cramming huge bursts of emotional expression into tiny, mathematical,
efficient spaces. Berg used atonality to write some of the most passionate string
pieces of the century, including his Violin Concerto (1935) as well as the opera
Wozzeck.
All three wrote music that was jagged, passionate, and alarming, and which
reflected the artistic and political thought of the time. Despite their close
relationships, when Schoenberg fled the Nazis in 1933, Webern, a Nazi
sympathizer, stayed behind. He was accidentally shot by an American soldier in
1945. Berg died from complications stemming from a bug bite at age fifty, and
Schoenberg, who came to teach at the University of Southern California,
outlived them both.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Schoenberg hated the term atonal because he felt it implied "without tone.
"Instead, he suggested pantonal, emphasizing the all-inclusiveness ofhis style.
2. With Berg and Webern, Schoenberg founded the Society for Private Musical
Performances in Vienna in 1916. Only members were allowed to come to a
series of premieres by avant-garde composers, and no applause was allowed.
The series isolated the three from the public eye, but it encouraged free
dialogue among the artists involved.
3. Webern wrote only thirty-one catalogued pieces, many of them less than ten
minutes long.
SATURDAY, DAY 6
Existentialism
Existentialism is a term coined to describe the thinking of certain twentieth
century French philosophers such as Jean-Paul Sartre (1905-1980) and Albert
Camus (1913-1960). There is no single existentialist view on any given topic.
What binds the existentialists together is an emphasis on human freedom,
authenticity, and experiences like dread and anxiety.
The existentialists of the twentieth century had many influences, including the
Danish thinker Soren Kierkegaard (1813-1855). Kierkegaard wrote in defense of
religious faith. He argued that faith requires a voluntary, irrational leap into the
absurd. But he believed religious faith was the only antidote to despair, a
spiritual condition he described in his book The Sickness unto Death (1849).
Sartre and Camus wrote both fiction and philosophy. In his novel Nausea (1938),
Sartre described the sickening feeling that the world is absurd and devoid of
meaning. In his more straight-forwardly philosophical works, like Being and
Nothingness (1943), Sartre argued that man is free to choose his own destiny and
that the only thing we cannot do is fail to choose. However, he believed we often
try to escape our freedom by clinging to some unquestionable fact, like a system
of religious belief. He called this tendency "bad faith"
Camus is best known for his novels, especially The Stranger (1942) and The
Plague (1947). In the Stranger, the main character, Mersault, kills an Arab youth
for no apparent reason and is sentenced to death. As his execution approaches,
Mersault reflects on his life and his responsibility for the murder. Existentialist
themes of authenticity, responsibility for one's life, and freedom of choice run
through Camus's books.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Kierkegaard wrote many ofhis works under a variety ofpseudonyrns.
2. In Sartre's play No Exit, three strangers find themselves in an ominous hotel
room, which they cannot leave. Slowly, as they grow to hate one another, they
realize they are in hell. The play contains the famous declaration, "Hell is other
people."
3. Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900) was another important influence on
existentialism.
SUNDAY, DAY 7
Karma
Karma is the cycle of moral cause and effect that is central to the Hindu faith.
The traditions of Hinduism can be traced back as far as 3000 BC, and the faith
has no known founder. Hindus believe in a cycle of birth, life, death, and
reincarnation. During life, one's good or bad deeds affect one's karma. This
concept is often expressed by the notion, "As we sow, so shall we reap." Good
deeds lead to a good future; bad deeds lead to a bad future. As a guide to doing
good deeds or acts, Hindus follow the dharma, or "what is right" according to
ancient Hindu scriptures.
There are three aspects of karma. The first is prarabadha. Prarabadha is out of
our control. It describes the fundamental setup of our lives such as who our
parents are, which caste of society we are born into, where our house is. Such
conditions cannot be changed and are determined by our behavior in our
previous life.
The second aspect of karma is samchita. It describes how all our deeds in former
lives lead to our individual interests, tendencies, and persona. Samchita karma
explains why two children born into the same environment may nevertheless
have very different inclinations. Samchita karma can be changed during our
current lives with hard work and reflection. The bad habits we are born with can
be improved. On the other hand, good habits can deteriorate.
Finally, the third aspect of karma, agami, consists of the actions and deeds that
we do in our current lives, which will affect us in our current lives. For instance,
treating a neighbor well or poorly might determine how we are someday treated.
It is agami karma over which we have the most control.
Although the notion of karma also exists in Buddhism, Hindu karma is
significantly different in that it accounts for the intervention of a god. Hindus
believe that when someone dies, a supernatural being, known as Brahman,
weighs the good and evil done by that person and assigns them their next place
of reincarnation. Moreover, if a few bad deeds are followed by many good
deeds, it is believed that Brahman can mitigate the negative effect of those early
mistakes. Buddhists, on the hand, view karma as an absolute natural law.
ADDITIONAL FACT
1. Karma is a means ofexplaining why evil exists in a world with God. The evil
deeds ofpeople create negative karma which yields more evil in lives to come.
MONDAY, DAY I
Holocaust
Near the end of World War 11, the 45`h Infantry Division of the US Army
received orders to capture a small city in Southern Germany. Lieutenant Colonel
Felix Sparks, the division's commander, entered the town, sending a detachment
of his battle-hardened troops to a nearby Nazi concentration camp alongside the
railway. The name of the camp, and the town, was Dachau.
What Sparks witnessed that morning in Dachau would soon haunt the
conscience of the world. In the pleasant Bavarian forest, thousands of innocent
people lay dead or dying. The remaining German soldiers around Dachau put up
little resistance. As the horrified men of the 45" division entered the camp, the
smell of human flesh hung in the forest air. "The scene near the entrance to the
confinement area numbed my senses," Sparks later told historians. "Dante's
Inferno seemed pale compared to the real hell of Dachau."
Dachau had been a gruesome prototype: The first concentration camp Adolf
Hitler opened shortly after taking power in Germany in 1933. At first, the camp
housed opponents of the Nazi regime, but during the war the Nazis imprisoned
German citizens simply for being Jewish. More than 30,000 prisoners had been
systematically murdered at Dachau-a horrifying total but a mere fraction of the
six million Jews killed across Europe during the Nazi Holocaust. The gas
chambers at Auschwitz, a concentration camp in Nazi-occupied Poland,
accounted for more than one million of the deaths.
Only as the British, Soviet, and American armies began to liberate Nazi
concentration camps in the spring of 1945 did the full extent of German brutality
begin to emerge. In the name of ethnic purity, Hitler and his henchmen had
ordered the extermination of the entire Jewish population in Germany and Nazi-
occupied Europe. The Nazi camps also murdered untold thousands of Gypsies,
Poles, gays, and political opponents. After the war, the Allies captured and
executed a number of German officials held responsible for the massive
genocide in Europe.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. A handful of Sparks's soldiers were so outraged that within minutes of
entering Dachau, they began summarily executing the camp's SS guards. The
American soldiers were court-martialed, but General George S. Patton ordered
the prosecutions to stop.
2. The architect and logistical planner of the Holocaust, Adolf Eichmann,
managed to escape from Europe in the chaos ofpostwar Germany and was not
captured until 1960 in Argentina. He was tried for crimes against humanity in
Israel, convicted, and hanged in 1962.
3. Despite the efforts of the Allies, most participants in the Holocaust were never
punished. For instance, of the 7, 000 SS troops that served atAuschwitz, only
800 were put on trial, according to one estimate.
TUESDAY, DAY 2
Romanticism
Romanticism was a wide-ranging intellectual and artistic movement that swept
Europe and the United States during the first half of the nineteenth century. It
was a direct reaction against the rationalism, precision, and restraint that had
dominated Western intellectual thought during the Enlightenment period of the
1700s. Once romanticism took root, it found its place in many arenas, from
literature to art to music.
Whereas Enlightenment thinkers valued empirical and rational thought,
romantics held that human emotion and passion were truer guides than reason or
the intellect. Romantic literature thus celebrates creativity, the imagination, the
senses, and the rejection of convention in favor of one's own individual visiona
perspective that English romantic poet William Blake encapsulated in his famous
declaration, "I must create a system or be enslaved by another man's." Not
surprisingly, many works of romantic literature exhibit a fascination with
anomalous or misunderstood characters, such as geniuses or madmen. These
figures may be grotesque, such as the monster in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
(1818), or merely marginalized from society, such as the wrongly imprisoned
Edmond Dantes in Alexandre Dumas's The Count of Monte Cristo (1844-1845).
The start of the romantic period in literature is often identified as 1798, when
English poets William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge published a
joint collection of poems entitled Lyrical Ballads. In 1800, Wordsworth added a
highly influential forward to Lyrical Ballads that defined poetry as a
"spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings." This blatant rejection of reason
became a call to arms for the romantic movement.
The early figureheads of romantic literature were its English poets: Blake,
Wordsworth, and Coleridge, along with John Keats, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and
Lord Byron. Before long, romanticism infiltrated prose and spread to other parts
of Europe, influencing such novels as Victor Hugo's The Hunchback of Notre-
Dame (1831). It later crossed the Atlantic, where American transcendentalist
writers built upon the romantics' appreciation of nature. In fact, most of the
major figures of mid-nineteenth-century American literature-Edgar Allan Poe,
Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville, and others-fall solidly in the romantic
tradition.
By the late 1800s, romanticism subsided in favor of realism, which was ushered
in by works such as Gustave Flaubert's Madame Bovary (1857). Its influence has
remained significant, however, and the works of romantic poets and novelists
remain among the most popular of the Western canon.
ADDITIONAL FACT
1. With its roots in the passionate, emotional works of Ludwig van Beethoven,
romanticism flourished in music throughout the nineteenth century. Major
composers included Frederic Chopin, Richard Wagner, and Piotr Ilych
Tchaikovsky.
WEDNESDAY, DAY 3
Pablo Picasso
Pablo Picasso (1881-1973) was one of the most famous and influential artists of
the twentieth century. He founded and mastered such an enormous range of
styles throughout his eighty-year career that he may well be considered the most
prolific and versatile painter of all time.
Born in Malaga, Spain, Picasso was a child prodigy. His father, an art teacher,
recognized and fostered the young boy's talent. At the turn of the twentieth
century, Picasso went to Paris, the center of the avant-garde art scene at the time.
Following his best friend's suicide in 1901, Picasso entered what has since
become known as his Blue Period; he painted compositions in various shades of
blue in order to convey the sadness and poverty of his subjects. By 1904, Picasso
had switched to warmer tones and entered his Rose Period, when he began
focusing on images of circus performers and harlequins.
In 1907, Picasso painted his first cubist picture, Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.
Departing from western canons of female beauty, he used Polynesian, Iberian,
and African sculptures as models for the figures. By rejecting the rules of one-
point perspective-the dominant technique since the Renaissance-Picasso and
fellow cubist Georges Braques changed the course of art forever.
Picasso constantly revised his styles and approach to painting. In 1917, for
example, he began restoring color to his monochromatic cubist paintings. Later,
in Three Musicians (1921), he combined cubist elements with vivid colors and
lively patterns to capture the dynamic rhythm of the figures. In the late 1920s
Picasso became involved in the surrealist movement. Intrigued by the concept of
metamorphosis, he produced paintings of half-human, half-bestial creatures
throughout the 1930s. During this phase, Picasso also wrote poetry and a
surrealist play entitled Desire Caught by the Tail (1941).
Picasso's work became more political in the mid-1930s after the onset of the
Spanish Civil War. His best-known painting of this type, Guernica (1937),
depicts the annihilation of a small Basque town by German bombers
commanded by the Fascist general, Francisco Franco. Throughout World War II
Picasso lived in Nazi-occupied Paris, where fame protected him from
persecution. Picasso's creative energy did not weaken with age. He continued to
produce paintings, lithographs, and drawings until his death. When Picasso died
without leaving a will in 1973, the French government appropriated much of his
estate to found the Musee Picasso in Paris.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. In addition to the Music Picasso in Paris, there are major collections ofPicasso
s works in the Muses Picasso in Malaga and the Museu Picasso in Barcelona as
well as in both the Museum of Modern Art and the Metropolitan Museum
ofArt in New York City.
2. Picasso's early painting Garcon 4 la Pipe sold for $104 million in 2004, a
world record for d painting.
THURSDAY, DAY 4
The Pythagorean Theorem
Pythagoras was a Greek philosopher of the sixth century BC and the leader of a
cult that worshiped numbers. His cult prayed to the tetraktys, the first four digits.
One represented reason, two represented argument, three harmony, and four
justice. Out of their religion ofmathematics sprang some ofthe most elegant
geometric proofs in the history of mankind, including the proof that bares
Pythagoras's name, the Pythagorean theorem. It simply states that for all right
triangles (triangles with a 90 degree angle), a2 + b2 = c2, where a and b are the
short sides of the triangle and c is the longest side, the hypotenuse. According to
legend, Pythagoras was so excited when he proved the theorem that he sacrificed
a bull.
Of course, many cultures knew about the theorem before Pythagoras proved it.
The Babylonians knew that az + b2 = c2 at least 1,000 years before the time of
Pythagoras, and the ancient Egyptians probably used the formula to build the
pyramids circa 2550 BC. By 600 BC, it was known in China, India, and most of
Mesopotamia. Pythagoras is simply given credit for being the first one to prove
it in Western culture. Hundreds of proofs of the Pythagorean theorem exist
today. But here is just one of them.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. A Pythagorean triple is a set of three whole numbers a, b, and c, such that a2 +
b2 = c2. Two well-known examples are (3, 4, 5) and (5, 12, 13).
2. Presidentjames Garfield wrote his own proofofthe Pythagorean theorem in
1876.
3. In China, the theorem is called the Gougu theorem, and it originally appeared
in a mathematical treatise dated between 500 BC and 200 AD.
FRIDAY, DAY 5
Schoenberg's Pierrot Lunaire
This piece, whose title means "Moonstruck Pierrot," opened the floodgates for
atonality and avant-garde composition in the twentieth century. It is a series of
twenty-one miniature pieces for soprano and a small chamber group. The text,
from the poetry of Belgian symbolist Albert Giraud, describes in sickly, often
frightening episodes, the protagonist's love for the moon, "feverishly swollen" in
the black night sky, as well as other disturbing images, including madness and
decapitation.
Pierrot Lunaire premiered in Berlin in 1912, to a huge public uproar, but a wildly
positive critical response. Many critics see it as the most important piece of the
expressionist movement. Expressionism, in both visual art and music, was an
introspective sensibility that coincided with the world's embrace of Freudian
psychology. Expressionist painters such as Oskar Kokoschka sought to explore
the nether regions of their minds, bringing to light their Freudian dream-states
and unconscious desires.
Arnold Schoenberg's work sought to do the same. It was one of the first pieces of
music to use the technique of sprechstimme, a method of vocalization that fell
halfway between speech and song. The composer notated approximate pitches
with an X on the staff paper. A written manuscript that accompanied Pierrot
indicated that the performer was to strike the note for only a moment, then drop
away, avoiding any sustained pitches. It is one of the most challenging vocal
pieces ever written, but it is more important for its theoretical innovations.
After Pierrot, it became clear to the musical world that melody and tonality no
longer had a grip on composers' aspirations. Later composers, including
Schoenberg's student John Cage, eliminated more and more vestiges of tonal
music, but in 1912, Pierrot Lunaire sent a clear message. It can be seen as a
definitive breaking point in Western music.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Igor Stravinsky, who was at the premiere as a young man, later described
seeing Pierrot as a life-changing experience.
2. The character ofPierrot coin es from the Italian theater genre ofcommedia
dell'arte, and in that tradition was a clumsy, comic harlequin. For some
performances of Pierrot Lunaire, the soloist dresses in harlequin costume.
3. Schoenberg was also an expressionist painter, and he understood the links that
visual art had in common with modernist musical compositions.
SATURDAY, DAY 6
Analytic Philosophy
Analytic philosophy is a tradition that dominates academic philosophy in the
English-speaking world and Scandinavia. What binds analytic philosophers
together is a shared intellectual heritage, some broad agreement on the nature of
philosophical problems, and an emphasis on clarity of expression and rigorous
argument.
Analytic philosophy first arose in England in the early twentieth century. G. E.
Moore (18731958) and Bertrand Russell (1872-1970) were heavily influenced
by recent advances in logic, especially in the foundations of mathematics. This
gave their philosophy a strong emphasis on logic and on language. In fact, they
approached many philosophical problems through the logical analysis of
language. Russell's student Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951) developed these
ideas in his book Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, in which he described the
logical structure of language and the world.
Another important influence on analytic philosophy was logical positivism,
developed by the Vienna Circle, a group of philosophers and scientists who lived
in Vienna in the 1920s. The positivists saw no role for philosophy other than in
analyzing the logical structure of scientific theories. The British philosopher A.
J. Ayer (1910-1989), who was not a member of the Vienna circle, popularized
many positivist ideas in Britain and the United States in his book Language
Truth and Logic.
Analytic philosophy is often contrasted with continental philosophy, which is
practiced in Europe. Continental philosophy tends to focus more on the history
of philosophy and its role within culture and history.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Russell pointed out a contradiction in fellow philosopher Gottlob Frege's
logical system and Frege was plunged into despair over the failure ofhis life's
work.
2. Late in his life, A. I Ayer purportedly encountered Mike Tyson at New York
party. Ayer thought that Tyson was behaving inappropriately and said as much.
Tysonresponded Do you have any idea who Iam? I'm the heavyweight
champion ofthe world! "Ayer replied, "Yes, andI am the former Wykeham
professor oflogic at Oxford. We are both preeminent in our field. Let us discuss
this as reasonable men."
SUNDAY, DAY 7
Hindu Epics
In the Hindu tradition, there are two important epics-the Mahabharata and the
Ramayana.
The Mahabharata, which means "Great Epic of the Bharata Dynasty," is the
second longest epic known to exist, containing more than 100,000 verses. Its
origins can be traced back as far as 3000 BC, but its current form was most
likely compiled around 300-400 AD.
The Mahabharata tells of an ancient battle waged thousands of years ago
between two related clans. The two clans were the Pandavas and the
Dhartarashtas. Originally they shared a kingdom, but after losing a game of dice,
the Pandavas were banished for twelve years. When they attempted return after
the banishment, the Dhartarashtas refused to relinquish half of the land. Thus, a
horrible war ensued, in which relatives and friends were forced to fight against
each other, and eventually the Pandavas emerged victories.
Within the overall plot, many minor stories highlight Hindu ideals and lessons.
One such episode is the Bhagavad Gita, a sermon delivered by the god Krishna
to Arjuna when Arjuna hesitated on the battlefield. The teachings of the
Bhagavad Gita lay out many of the Hindu faith's central tenets.
Krishna told Arjuna that, despite his fears, he should not shy away from battle.
The only way for someone to achieve salvation was by facing one's duties in life.
Krishna taught that this material world was an illusion and that the soul was
eternal. By going through this world and remaining devoted to God, one could
actually be removed from the endless cycle of death and rebirth and become one
with God. Thus, Krishna told Arjuna to be unafraid of death on the battlefield
because shedding one's body can actually lead to oneness with God.
The other major Hindu epic, the Ramayana, is much shorter than the
Mahabharata at 24,000 verses. This epic tells the tale of Rama, who was
banished with his wife, Sita, after failing to succeed his father to the throne. In
exile, Sita is captured by another king, and Rama tries at length to save her.
Eventually he does, but he worries about her sexual purity after living in another
man's house. Rama tests Sita by placing her in a fire. When she survives, he
believes she is pure again. However, rumors of her infidelity continue, and Rama
is forced to expel Sita. Sita then gives birth to Rama's two sons who proceed to
tell Rama's story, the Ramayana, wherever they go. This epic contains important
lessons regarding devotion, family loyalty, and respect for one's elders.
ADDITIONAL FACT
1. It is said of the Mahabharata: "What is found herein may also be found in
other sources. What is not found herein does not matter."
MONDAY, DAY I
The Battle of Midway
The Battle of Midway, a giant naval clash between the United States and Japan,
marked the turning point of World War II in the Pacific. During the battle, the
Japanese lost four of the ten aircraft carriers in their entire fleet, a crippling blow
to their naval strength. The United States lost one carrier, the USS Yorktown.
The consequence of the American victory at Midway proved enormous. Six
months after the surprise Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States had
rebounded to gain the upper hand in the Pacific.
Japan and the United States had drifted toward war throughout the late 1930s
and early 1940s. From a reclusive island kingdom in the nineteenth century,
Japan had transformed itself into a major industrial power. Japan's defeat of
Russia in the Russo-Japanese War in 1904-1905 signaled its arrival as a
significant military force. Shortly thereafter, Japan began invading and pillaging
its neighbors. By 1910, Korea and the island of Taiwan belonged to Japan. In the
1930s, Imperial Japanese forces invaded mainland China, triggering a war that
killed tens of millions of Chinese. Japan's military strategists saw the United
States as the main obstacle to total domination of the Asian Pacific area.
The United States, the only power that could check Japan's expansion, had little
interest in the 1930s. After the horrors of World War I, the isolationist American
public wanted no part in foreign entanglements. When Hitler declared war on
Great Britain, the United States was widely sympathetic to its traditional British
ally but remained officially neutral. Only the bombing of Pearl Harbor on
December 7, 1941, forced President Franklin D. Roosevelt to ask for a
congressional declaration of war against Japan.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. The battle took its name from Midway Atoll, a tiny group of uninhabited
Pacific islands discovered by an American sea captain in 1859 and turned into
a military base during the war. The islands, which remain US property, are now
home to a National Wildlife Refuge.
2. As a diversion, the Japanese sent forces to take the Aleutian Islands in Alaska,
hoping that the Americans would waste resources trying to defend them. The
gambit didn't work, but the Aleutians were the only piece ofany of the current
fifty US states that the Japanese conquered during the war.
TUESDAY, DAY 2
"Sonnet 18"
William Shakespeare's towering plays often overshadow the fact that he also
wrote 154 sonnets, many of which are great achievements of English literature.
First published as a collection in 1609, these sonnets are a profound collective
meditation on love, poetry, and death. Among the set, the eighteenth sonnet is
the best known and most frequently quoted.
Readers often assume that "Sonnet 18" is addressed to a young woman, an
object of the speaker's romantic love. But though the sonnet is indeed a love
poem, it is actually an expression of love for a male friend-the same nameless
young gentleman to whom the first 126 of Shakespeare's sonnets are addressed.
The early sonnets in the set are reserved, advising the young man on lessons of
life and marriage. But the later sonnets grow increasingly passionate in
emotion, demonstrating joy, disappointment, and jealousy with an intensity
more typical of a romantic relationship than a friendship. Though scholars have
long debated the identity of the young man and the nature of his relationship to
the narrator, the matter is clouded by uncertainty. It is unclear even whether
Shakespeare is narrating.
"Sonnet 18" meditates on beauty, transience, and the enduring power of art.
The speaker notes that the beauty of nature, and even of the sun itself, fades
with time and the passage of the seasons. But because the young man's beauty
is recorded in the form of this sonnet, his "eternal summer shall not fade." Even
death itself is impotent against the endurance of the sonnet, for the poem,
through its "eternal lines," effectively "gives life" to the young man "so long as
men can breathe or eyes can see"
The sonnet form that Shakespeare popularized originally emerged in Italy in
the 1300s, pioneered by Dante Alighieri and Petrarch. In most Italian sonnets,
the opening eight lines, or octave, pose a question or dilemma that is then
answered or commented upon in the final six lines, or sestet. The form changed
slightly on its way to England: rather than divide between octave and sestet,
most English sonneteers used three four-line quatrains, followed by a final
couplet that brings an unexpected twist or development. It is this form that
Shakespeare employed.
WEDNESDAY, DAY 3
Guernica
Pablo Picasso's Guernica-a shocking and powerful image of modern
warfaredepicts the chaos wrought by German bombers on a small town during
the Spanish Civil War.
In January of 1937, the Republican government of Spain commissioned a
painting from Picasso, the most renowned Spanish painter of the period, for their
pavilion at the International Exposition in Paris.
On April 26, German bombers, commanded by fascist authorities, destroyed the
Basque town of Guernica in northern Spain. This, in fact, was the first aerial
assault on a strictly civilian target in human history. Picasso, dismayed at the
event and sympathetic to the Republicans, made the attack the subject of a huge
(eleven by twenty-five feet) mural, hoping to draw international attention to the
horrific war. Dora Maar, Picasso's mistress at the time, documented his progress
in a series of photographs.
The composition of Guernica consists of a central triangle flanked by two
rectangles. At the apex of the triangle, the starkly illuminated head of an injured
horse conveys the suffering of all the innocent victims. To its left is a bull that,
according to Picasso, represents brutality and darkness. Below the bull, a
lamenting woman holds her dead child in a pose evocative of Christian images
of the Virgin holding her crucified son. Sprawled at the foot of the picture is a
fallen townsman, clutching a broken sword with which he had hoped to combat
the fighter planes. On the right are three more figures in agony. The painting is
done in a style reminiscent of synthetic cubism. Although Picasso did not use
collage, some of the figures look as though they were cut out of newsprint and
pasted onto the canvas.
After the work was exhibited at the Parisian Exposition, it was sent to
Scandinavia, then to London. When the fascists triumphed in Spain, Picasso
requested that Guernica be sent to the Museum of Modern Art in New York. He
specified that the painting should be returned to Spain only when the country
had been liberated from fascism. After Generalissimo Franco's death in 1981, the
painting was sent to Madrid, where it can be seen today in the Museo Reina
Sofia.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. A tapestry copy of Guernica was commissioned by Nelson Rockefeller for the
United Nations.
2. Basque nationalists have petitioned to have the painting sent to the new
Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, thirty miles west of Guernica.
THURSDAY, DAY 4
The Golden Ratio
The arms of a starfish, the spiral of a conch, and the petals of a rose have
something in common with the Parthenon in Athens and the Pyramids of Giza.
They are all structured around a number known as the Golden Ratio. It is also
called phi after the Greek sculptor Phidias, who used it artfully in his works. In
mathematical notation, it is written cp. Phi is approximately equal to 1.618, but it
is an irrational number, which means the decimals go on forever without ever
repeating in a pattern.
Here is how we find phi. Two line segments are said to be in Golden proportion
if the ratio of the shorter line (S) to the longer line (L) is equal to the ratio of the
longer line to the sum of both lines.
If we solve for L using the quadratic equation, we find that
Objects constructed in a golden ratio are visually pleasing to the human eye.
They show up again and again in art and nature. Examine the three common
shapes below.
In the regular pentagram, all five sides are equal in length. This causes the sides
to be in Golden proportion to the five diagonals connecting the points. The
ancient Greek philosopher Pythagoras was so impressed by the regular
pentagram that he chose it as the secret symbol for his religious sect, which
worshiped numbers.
The cross is a common graveyard cross that was first examined by a German
psychologist named Gustav Fechner. He noticed that the upper and lower
portions of the main stem are in a perfect golden ratio.
In the triangle, the long sides are in golden proportion to the short side.
ADDITIONAL FACTS:
1. The length and width of the Mona Lisa's face are in golden proportion.
2. The human body is riddled with golden ratios.
3. Michelangelo arranged his painting The Holy Family in a regular
pentagram.
FRIDAY, DAY 5
Twelve-Tone Serialism
With works like Pierrot Lunaire, Arnold Schoenberg was challenging the world's
ears, but his new system of atonality was still "free atonality," the grammar of
this new musical language having not yet been formally developed. The solution
was Schoenberg's codification, in his theoretical writings and his later
compositions, of a system called twelve-tone serialism.
Twelve-tone serialism is a way of making sure each of the twelve chromatic
tones in Western music (C-C#-D-D#-E-F-F#-G-G#-A-A#-B) is given equal
importance. It garnered Schoenberg the most criticism of his career. He was
accused of making music too technical and dry by mixing it up with
mathematics. And, in the end, the modernists' assault on tonality and other
conventions was probably more important to music than the twelve-tone system.
Few contemporary composers still use it as a guide.
Serialism works as follows: Schoenberg took the twelve pitches and arranged
them into a series, which he called a row. The row serves as the melodic guide
for the piece, with the basic rule being that no note can be repeated until the
entire row has been played. In addition, the composer may manipulate the row
by writing it backward (retrograde), by turning it upside down (inversion), by
transposing it, or by any combination of these techniques.
In his writing, Schoenberg avoided intervals that he saw as tonal, or pleasing
harmonies such as octaves and thirds, that suggested a tonal center. Despite its
dryness and harsh sound, twelve-tone music remained the central style for
"serious" composers from around the end of World War II until the 1970s, when
it gave way to electronic music, minimalism, the new tonality, and other new
musical styles.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Schoenberg's pupil Alban Berg developed his own style whereby he
incorporated tonal intervals and other elements, but he remained loyal to
serialist techniques.
2. Anton Webern wrote cellular compositions in the twelve-tone tradition.
Within each row, he created repeating rhythmic, harmonic, and intervallic
patterns.
SATURDAY, DAY 6
Truth
In ordinary use, we say that many things are true: There are true friends, true
ideas, and true wisdom. However, philosophy concentrates on truth as it applies
to sentences. Some sentences are true, while some are false. What exactly is the
difference? This is the philosophical problem of truth.
According to one popular philosophical view, truth consists in a correspondence
between a sentence and the world; a true sentence is a sentence that corresponds
to a fact. Philosophers who accept this view have to explain what this
correspondence relation is, and under what conditions it exists. They also have to
define facts. The notable feature of this theory is the claim that truth is a
relationship between language (sentences) and parts of the world (facts) that are
not themselves parts of language. Thus, truth is a relation between sentences and
objective, language-independent reality.
Other philosophers think that the truth of a sentence depends on its coherence
with another set of sentences. According to this theory, to say a sentence is true
is to say it fits well with other things we hold true. Coherence theories have to
explain what the relation of coherence is, and under what conditions it exists,
and which group of sentences we should judge the truth of other sentences
against. This theory contends we could not turn out to be wrong about
everything. We might be wrong about some of our beliefs but the set of
privileged sentences we judge others against is, by definition, true (provided it is
consistent).
A third view is the deflationary theory of truth. According to this approach,
saying that a sentence is true is just a convenient way to endorse that sentence.
For instance, imagine Jane and Bill are in a long meeting, and Jane says, "We're
all tired. We should take a break." Bill would also like to take a break, and so
instead of repeating Jane's words, he simply says, "That's true." According to the
deflationary theory of truth, saying that some sentence is true is just another way
of saying that sentence. On this view, there is no property of truth that all true
sentence share.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Some philosophers have taken the correspondence theory of truth to be so
obvious as not to require argument.
2. Consider the following sentence: This sentence is false. If this sentence is true,
then it is false. But if it is false, then it is true. This is called the paradox ofthe
liar.
SUNDAY, DAY 7
Caste System
The Indian caste system is a structure of social segregation that is deeply
ingrained in both Indian political history and the religion of Hinduism.
According to Hindu tradition, the god Brahma created a man from clay, and four
castes arose from his body parts. Brahmans (priests) arose from his mouth,
Kshatriyas (rulers and warriors) arose from his arms, Vaishyas (landowners and
merchants) arose from his thighs, and Sudras (artisans and servants) arose from
his feet. Years later, a fifth caste, known as Dalit, or "downtrodden," emerged
who were charged with, among other things, cleaning human waste.
Membership in the castes is determined by birth and is based on the concept of
karma. If one does good deeds during this life, he or she will be reincarnated in a
higher caste. On the other hand, bad deeds lead to lower castes. Once in a caste,
a member cannot change, and the hardships that must be endured are seen as
divinely ordained.
There is also a loose correlation between caste and skin color. Traditionally,
lighter skinned Indians were believed to be of higher caste than those with
darker skin. However, this is less true today. In addition to these five overarching
castes, there are hundreds of sub-castes throughout India. These are broken
down based on more specific occupation, physical location, and genealogy.
Although many castes live in the same cities and are economically dependent on
one another for survival, some of the more remotely located castes are roughly
equivalent to isolated ethnic groups. Regardless of the distinctions, intermarriage
between castes is traditionally rare, although in recent years there has been some
increase.
Castes have a number of other social and religious implications. While the first
four castes are considered clean, the Dalit are unclean. This has led to such rules
as forcing the Dalit to ring a bell wherever they go, warning others of their
approach.
Higher castes-the Brahmins, Kshatriyas, and Vaishyas-are seen as twice-born.
Between the ages of eight and twelve, depending on caste, members come of age
and are considered to have a rebirth. This rebirth allows them to fully practice
the Hindu faith.
In order to compensate for past inequalities, the Indian government has instituted
a program known as reservations. This is somewhat similar to affirmative action,
but it is much more explicitly codified. Jobs that have been reserved, require a
certain quota of each caste to fill the open positions.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Nepal, the only country whose state religion is Hinduism, also has a caste
system. This system originated in 1854 with the authorizing document Muluki
Ain.
2. The fifth caste, Dalit, are more commonly known in the West as untouchables.
However, this term is considered to be derogatory in India today.
MONDAY, DAY 1
D-Day
On June 6, 1944-D-Day-Allied forces invaded Nazi-controlled Europe. The
scale of the invasion was without precedent. In a single day, more than 150,000
American, British, and Canadian troops crossed the English Channel and landed
on the coast of France. More than 5,000 ships and 11,000 airplanes from a dozen
countries participated in the invasion, which had been planned practically since
the French surrender in 1940. With l)-Day, the Allied liberation of Europe finally
began. Germany's collapse was swift. Less than a year later, Hitler was dead,
Germany was in ruins, and the war in Europe was over.
The human carnage on D-Day was immense. More than 4,000 Allied troops and
thousands of Germans died during the invasion. The American troops who
landed at Omaha Beach in Normandy, one of the main landing sites, suffered
tremendous losses. The German defenders, however, were overwhelmed by the
end of the day. "For each American I see fall, there came ten hundred other
ones!" a German gunner recalled years later to a historian. Hitler had known an
invasion was imminent, but the Allies successfully tricked him into believing
they would land in a different part of France.
The impact of D-Day is incalculable. Before the landings, General Dwight D.
Eisenhower sent a message to the troops, urging them to victory. "The eyes of
the world are upon you," wrote Eisenhower, the supreme Allied commander in
Europe. "The hopes and prayers of libertyloving people everywhere march with
you" And indeed, the French greeted the Allies with jubilation. A few months
after the invasion, Paris was liberated. Soviet troops rushed in from the east,
dislodging the Nazis from Eastern Europe. Germany could not fight the war on
both fronts, and by the spring of 1945, the Nazi regime was finished, allowing
the Allies to focus on defeating the remaining Axis power, Japan.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Contrary to widespread belief the D in D-Day doesn't actually stand for
anything. D-Day is a generic military term for the day on which something
begins-in this case Operation Overlord, the code name for the Normandy
invasion.
2. Even the planning for D-Day took a deadly toll on the Allies. In practice
operations in April and May of 1944, theAllies lost 12,000 men-killed or
injured-and 2, 000 airplanes.
3. Pigeons played an important role in D-Day. Before the invasion, members of
the underground French resistance spied on German troops and sent their reports
to London tied around the legs of homing pigeons.
TUESDAY, DAY 2
Leo Tolstoy
Though history has produced many great novelists, arguably none is held in
higher esteem than Leo Tolstoy (1828-1910). The status this Russian master
enjoys among readers and critics is exceeded only by his even greater veneration
among writers, who have long regarded him as a virtually untouchable genius.
Tolstoy wrote prolifically, but his reputation rests largely on two great works,
War and Peace (1865-1869) andAnna Karenina (1875-1877), which have served
as archetypes for the modern novel. These masterpieces of realism combine
unprecedented depth of characterization and keenness of observation with a
profound interest in the philosophical underpinnings of everyday life.
Born to a prominent family in the Russian nobility, Tolstoy began a university
education but grew bored and dropped out before earning a degree. During the
restless years that followed, he served in the army, opened a school, and
traveled throughout Europe, unable to find direction. In 1862, Tolstoy settled
down in an infamously unhappy marriage that nonetheless produced thirteen
children.
During the second half of the 1860s, Tolstoy wrote his first great
masterpiece, War and Peace. This vast novel, set during the Napoleonic Wars,
culminates in France's 1812 invasion of Russia-the famously doomed assault that
fell victim to the harsh Russian winter. The novel mixes fact and fiction, with a
large cast of invented characters sharing the stage with Napoleon, Tsar
Alexander I, and other real-life figures. Although much has been made of the
work's length, it reads surprisingly quickly due to its masterful intertwining of
individual stories with the wider sweep of history. Ultimately, Tolstoy concludes
that the great shaping force of history is the unpredictability and irrationality of
human behavior.
The intimate focus of Tolstoy's second masterpiece, Anna Karen ina, is evident
from its legendary opening: "All happy families are alike; each unhappy family
is unhappy in its own way." The title character is an intelligent, beguiling woman
who seeks the romantic love that her husband, a devoted but bland government
official, fails to provide. After falling in love with a debonair military officer,
Anna gives up her marriage and young son to pursue love, only to receive
society's scorn for her adultery. Tolstoy's description of the moments before
Anna's final, tragic suicide is a masterpiece of realism and considered one of the
finest scenes in literature.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. In his later years, Tolstoy advocated pacifism, anarchy, and devout
Christianity. He ultimately renounced material possessions entirely,
precipitating an irreconcilable split with his wife.
2. Tolstoy held the official title ofcountand came from a long line ofRussian
nobility.
WEDNESDAY, DAY 3
Marc Chagall
Marc Chagall (1887-1985) is best known for his stained glass windows, murals,
and tapestries of biblical themes. He also made many paintings evoking the
small Belarusian village where he had been born.
Moishe Zakharovich Shagalov was born in 1887 in Vitebsk, then part of the
Russian Empire. He was the eldest of nine children in a Hasidic family. After
studying art near home, he moved to Saint Petersburg, where he studied under
Leon Bakst.
In 1911, Chagall moved to Paris, where he met the artists Amedeo Modigliani,
Chaim Soutine, and Robert Delaunay. His brightly colored, geometric
compositions from this period reflect the influence of both fauvism and cubism,
though he never associated himself with any modernist movement. Typical of his
work at this stage is I and the Village (1911), which depicts life in Vitebsk in a
cubist style, while still evoking the spirit of Russian folktales and Jewish
proverbs.
Chagall was visiting his hometown in 1914 when World War I broke out,
preventing his return to Paris. In 1915, he married Bella Rosenfeld, who later
became one of his favorite subjects. After the Russian Revolution, he was
appointed Commissar of the Arts for the region of Vitebsk. When he was
replaced by Vera Yermoyaleva in 1919, he left for Moscow, where he designed
sets for Shalom Aleichem at the New State Kamerny Theater.
In 1922 to 1923, Chagall went to Berlin and from there to Paris, where he
worked on illustrations for Nikolai Gogol's Dead Souls, La Fontaine's Fables,
and the Bible. In 1941, Chagall sought asylum from the Nazis in the United
States. Profoundly affected by his wife's death in 1944, he painted works of
himself making contact with her spirit.
After World War II, in 1948, Chagall returned to Paris. Two years later, he
moved to Vence, where he worked on seventeen large paintings for the Chapelle
du Calvaire. Toward the end of his career, he designed stained glass windows for
Metz Cathedral, the Art Institute of Chicago, the United Nations, and Hebrew
University. In 1973, the Musee National du Message Biblique de Marc Chagall
opened in Nice. Today his works can be seen in major museums around the
world.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. In 2005, popular musician Tori Amos released Garlands, an album with lyrics
inspired by a series of Chagall lithographs.
2. Chagall stated, `All colors are the friends oftheir neighbors and the lovers
oftheir opposites."
THURSDAY, DAY 4
Fermat's Last Theorem
In 1637, mathematician Pierre de Fermat scribbled a mysterious note in the
margin of his copy of Arithetica. He wrote that there are no positive integers x,
y, and z such that x" + y" = z" , where n is an integer greater than two. He had a
"truly marvelous proof" for this statement, but he didn't have enough space in the
margin to write it down.
As far as anyone knows, Fermat never recorded his proof anywhere.
Mathematicians tried and tried to recreate what it might have been for hundreds
of years. Others attempted to solve the theorem themselves, doubting whether
Fermat had ever proved it in the first place. Some stopped trying, believing that
it was impossible. It became known as Fermat's last theorem, not because it was
the last theorem he ever wrote, but because it was the only one that had never
been verified.
It is well known that there are positive integers x, y, and z such that x2 + y2 = z2.
They are known as Pythagorean triples, and there are an infinite number of them.
But it is never the case that x3 + y3 = z3 (n =3) or that x' + y' = z' (n =4).
Although these special cases of n had been proven many times, it took 357 years
for someone to prove that n could equal any number great than two.
The answer came from professor Andrew Wiles from Princeton University in
1995. Combining seemingly unrelated branches of mathematics, notably elliptic
curves and modular forms, he wrote a 150-page proof, solving the problem that
had been itching mathematicians' scalps for generations. Wiles used many
twentieth century techniques that would have been unknown to Fermat. For this
reason, Wiles believes that Fermat never proved his theorem.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Wiles began to obsess over Fermat's last theorem when he was ten years old.
He always believed that it was his destiny to prove it.
2. Later in his life, Fermat wrote a proof for the special case in which n=4. Many
mathematicians speculate that ifhe had really proved thegeneral case for all n
greater than two, he would never had bothered to write the special case for n=4.
This is taken as further evidence that Fermat never proved his theorem.
FRIDAY, DAY 5
Igor Stravinsky
Inspired by Arnold Schoenberg, the rhythms of dance, Russian music idioms,
and the wisdom of the classical composers, Igor Stravinsky (1882-1971) came to
be the ultimate symbol of the modernist movement. He was smart, serious, and
cutting-edge-a meticulous artist who took his craft seriously, and as a result he
never ceased to be revolutionary.
Stravinsky was born in Saint Petersburg, where he met and studied with the
Russian nationalist composer Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. In 1909, Stravinsky
met Sergey Diaghilev, Russia's main ballet impresario and director of the Paris-
based Ballets Russes dance company. They would collaborate to produce three
of the most revolutionary ballets of all time. The first was The Firebird (1910), a
fairytale story colored by late romantic-era chromaticism. Next was Petrushka
(1911), a rhythmically original and charming story of a puppet that drew on folk
and burlesque themes. The most startling of the three ballets is The Rite of
Spring (1913), a piece based on an idea that came to Stravinsky one afternoon
while composing Firebird. He imagined a young girl forced to sacrifice herself
to a fertility god in front of a group of elders by dancing herself to death.
The piece starts off with a haunting, visceral bassoon solo, its melody taken from
an Eastern European folk song, and quickly goes into a violently dissonant, but
ruthlessly precise exercise that inspires, if not the scene that Stravinsky
imagined, surely a morbid, chaotic image. The insistent rhythms and repeated
melodic motives of this work marked a new era. Stravinsky later worked in both
neo-classical and twelve-tone styles, constantly developing his art in new ways.
In 1939, Stravinsky came to America and settled in Hollywood, tired of
European life and working on a commission for a Symphony of Psalms. His later
works include the opera The Rake's Progress and the ballet Agon.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. At the premiere of The Rite of Spring, hissing and booing erupted within the
first minute, and after few more, a riot ensued, with audience members
punching each other and screaming so loudly that the dancers could not hear
the music and were forced to stop.
2. Also present at the premiere of The Rite of Spring were composers Claude
Debussy and Maurice Ravel. While Debussy tried to calm the crowd, Ravel
was shouting "Genius! Genius!"in admiration.
3. The libretto for the late-stage opera The Rake's Progess was written by poet
W. H. Auden.
SATURDAY, DAY 6
Justice
The question of justice is one of the most important philosophical problems, and
one with significant real-world applications. What is a just way to behave? What
kinds of political institutions are just? And what does it even mean to be just?
Plato's The Republic was one of the first philosophical works to deal with this
question. Plato concluded that a just society is one rigidly organized and ruled by
wise kings who understand the true nature of the world.
Modern philosophers have come to very different conclusions. John Stuart Mill
proposed a utilitarian theory of justice. According to Mill, a just set of
institutions, or a just society, is one that maximizes the well-being of its citizens.
For instance, a utilitarian defense of punishing criminals would be: Punishing
criminals is just because it makes others less willing to do wrong, and thus leads
to less overall wrongdoing.
John Rawls was another philosopher with a famous theory of how to measure
justice. Rawls asked us to imagine a hypothetical situation in which human
beings do not yet have a government and are choosing their own political
system. To ensure that the system they choose is just, he argued, they should
have to make their decisions from behind a veil of ignorance. What this means is
that they must agree to a set of institutions and laws without knowing what share
of wealth, talent, and status they will have under the new system. This procedure
will ensure that the institutions will be rationally acceptable to a person who
knows he or she might turn out to be the least-powerful person in the system.
Rawls argued that a truly just political arrangement is one that could have been
chosen by rational agents from behind this veil of ignorance.
ADDITIONAL FACT
1. Perhaps the most famous critique ofRawls's theory ofjustice was by his
Harvard colleague Robert mozick. In his book Anarchy State and Utopia,
Nozick argued that theories such as Rawls's would lead to systematic violations
of individual rights.
SUNDAY, DAY 7
Taoism
Taoism is one of China's ancient spiritual traditions. Today it is viewed as both a
philosophy and a religion. People who see it as a religion view taoism's most
important contributor, Laozi, to be a god.
Taoism emerged during the philosophically fertile period in China known as the
Hundred Schools of Thought, which lasted from approximately 700-200 BC. It
gained momentum during the Han dynasty and solidified into its current form
during the fifth century AD.
Laozi, taoism's founder, was said to be a contemporary of Confucius and served
a Chinese emperor as the keeper of the Imperial Library. According to legend, at
the end of his life, Laozi left the Chinese court and traveled west. As he reached
the last gate of the Chinese Empire, he encountered a guard already familiar with
his great teachings. The guard asked Laozi to record his thoughts before leaving
China, and Laozi did so, writing the Tao Te Ching-the Book of Tao and Virtue.
Aside from Laozi, taoism also traces its roots to the Yellow Emperor, Huang-Di,
and taoism is sometimes known as Huang-Lao philosophy. Taoism also
considers one of Laozi's disciples, Zhuangzi, to be a very influential teacher.
The Tao Te Ching is a short book, comprising only 5,000 words. However, it
lays out the entire taoist philosophy. Tao, or "the way," is believed to be present
in everything that exists in the world. It is seen as the continuity behind life's
ever-changing forces.
Taoism calls for a reunification with tao. Taoists believe that the world has
become overrun with conflict and that by reuniting with tao, we can achieve
harmony. Taoism advocates both self-cultivation and social transformation.
For the self, it suggests spontaneity, a healthy lifestyle including breathing
exercises, and the minimization of desires. Taoists do not believe in an afterlife,
emphasizing the importance of being peaceful and harmonious in this life.
Socially, taoism suggests minimizing government intervention and warfare.
Unlike Confucianism, which relies upon society, taoism suggests that a solitary
life is a sufficient existence.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Taoism was officially suppressed during Mao Zedong's rule of communist
China, and now the largest concentration of taoists live in Taiwan.
2. Feng shui and tai chi are both taoist practices.
MONDAY, DAY I
Manhattan Project
In August of 1939, the famous scientist Albert Einstein wrote a short letter to
Franklin D. Roosevelt, the president of the United States, expressing his deepest
fear that Nazi Germany might develop an atomic bomb out of uranium. The
effects of such a bomb in the hands of the Nazis, Einstein told the president,
would be unimaginable. "A single bomb of this type, carried by boat and
exploded in a port," he wrote, "might very well destroy the whole port together
with some of the surrounding territory." As the news from Europe turned
increasingly ominous that summer on the eve of War World II, at his adopted
home in leafy Princeton, New Jersey, Einstein was increasingly despondent.
Einstein's letter was meant as a warning to Roosevelt, but it had an unintended
consequence. If Nazi Germany could develop such a terrifying weapon,
Roosevelt decided, the United States had better get one itself first. Before the
United States even entered the war in 1941, the American government had
started a program to study uranium's military potential. After Pearl Harbor, this
program grew into the Manhattan Project. After years of study at a remote site in
New Mexico, a team of Allied scientists finally perfected an atomic weapon in
1945.
At its busiest point during the war, the Manhattan Project brought together
hundreds of the world's top scientists. Such a gathering of great scientific minds
has never been matched. Like Einstein, many of the scientists were themselves
refugees from Nazi-occupied Europe. Altogether, the US government spent the
equivalent of about $20 billion on the bomb.
The bomb's use against the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945
destroyed the two major industrial centers crucial to the Japanese war effort and
killed 120,000 civilians. The bomb was intended to force the Japanese to
surrender, and it did. Days after the bombing of Nagasaki, Japan chose to give
up. The bomb's use in 1945 remains controversial. At the time, many American
generals, including Dwight D. Eisenhower, felt using the bomb was unnecessary
and would tarnish America's reputation. Others felt dropping the bomb would
hasten the end of the war. Einstein himself, the man whose discoveries had made
the bomb feasible, was horrified. After the war, he said he regretted warning
FDR of the atom's terrible powers.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. The first successful nuclear chain reaction tookplace in downtown Chicago in
1942, in a squash court under the bleachers of the football stadium at the
University of Chicago.
2. One of the British scientists who worked on the Manhattan Project in New
Mexico, Klaus Fuchs, later admitted to spying for the Soviet Union. Partially
aided by details pilfered by Fuchs and other spies, the Soviets tested their first
atomic weapon in 1949.
TUESDAY, DAY 2
"I, Too, Sing America"
Langston Hughes's "I, Too, Sing America" (1926) is one of the great poems
of the Harlem Renaissance, the resurgence of African-American cultural
awareness and artistic productivity that occurred during the 1920s. In just a
few elegant lines of free verse, Hughes expresses both the sad reality of
blacks' second-class status in American society and his own confident
optimism for the future.
"I, Too, Sing America" is a direct response to Walt Whitman's poem "I Hear
America Singing" (1881). Whitman had written about the glorious cacophony
of different voices that make up America-the mechanic, the carpenter, the
mother, and so on. Hughes, in his poem, contends that one major voice has
been forgotten and that Whitman's song is thus incomplete.
The power of Hughes's poem stems from its minimal, direct language. The
narrator begins with the bold declaration, "I, too, sing America," set into its
own stanza for emphasis, followed by a proud, unadorned assertion of his
identity-"I am the darker brother." He describes how he is denied a place at the
American "table," an extended metaphor in which "eat[ing] in the kitchen"
stands for all types of segregation and unequal opportunity.
But the narrator displays virtually no resentment or anger. Rather, he laughs off
the slights against him and brims with confidence that he is strong and beautiful
regardless of the denigration he has endured. Moreover, he is certain that his
own strength and achievement will inevitably cause the rest of America to
come to its senses. The lastline brings the poem full circle, repeating the
opening with a slight but important change: the narrator asserts, "I, too, am
America," convinced that he will someday be considered a true part of the
nation in which he lives, an equal partner in both its freedoms and its
responsibilities.
ADDITIONAL FACT
1. Hughes was launched to fame in 1921, when his first major poem, "The
Negro Speaks of Rivers," was published in the NAACP's Crisis magazine.
WEDNESDAY, DAY 3
American Gothic
American Gothic by Grant Wood (1891-1942) is one of the most widely known
works of American art. Although the painting is often viewed as a satire of
middle America, it was not intended to be so by its creator.
Wood spent the first ten years of his life on a farm in Iowa. After studying art in
Minneapolis, Chicago, and Paris, he returned to his home state where he applied
his talent to paint the world of his youth.
In August 1930, Wood came across a nineteenth century house in Eldon, Iowa,
built in a style known as carpenter Gothic. Imagining a farmer and his daughter
standing before their home, he made a rapid sketch on brown paper and took
some photos.
Woods reworked the composition at home, using his sister Nan as the model for
the girl, and a Cedar Rapids dentist, Dr. Byron McKeeby, for the farmer.
Drawing inspiration from Victorian photographs and nineteenth century
portraits, he transformed the dentist into a protective father and Nan into the old
man's plain-faced, unmarried daughter. Both wear austere clothing typical of the
Victorian era. Wood provided the farmer with a pitchfork in order to suggest an
earlier period, when such agricultural implements were still being used. Its
prongs complement the window frames of the house, and its rounded bottom
repeats the oval of the two faces. The immobile, stony expressions of the
characters recall those seen in early photographs, when long exposure times
forced subjects to remain still for up to five minutes.
Wood finished the painting just in time to enter it in a competition at the Art
Institute of Chicago. Much to his surprise, the painting won a bronze medal and
a $300 prize. Today it hangs permanently at the Institute.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. The pitchfork has been interpreted as a symbol ofrnasculinity, the devil, and
farming.
2. The house in the painting has drawn blinds and closed windows, a detail that
seems to emphasize the hostility andphobic attitude ofthe couple.
3. In 1934, Wood was appointed state director ofthe New Deal's Public Works of
Art Project. He later joined the faculty at the University ofIowa.
THURSDAY, DAY 4
The Prisoner's Dilemma
Two criminals are arrested for a robbery, and the police don't have enough
evidence to convict them. They separate the two suspects and make them the
same offer. If they both confess, they will both serve two years. If one of them
confesses, but the other one stays silent, the confessor will go free and the silent
partner will serve ten years in prison. However, if neither one of them says a
word-if they trust each other-they will both serve only six months. Neither one
knows what the other is going to do. Is it better to hold your tongue or squeal?
This hypothetical situation is known as the prisoner's dilemma, and it was first
proposed by mathematician Albert W. Tucker. It has important implications for
game theory, economics, evolution, and psychology.
The rational choice for prisoner A seems to be to betray his partner and confess.
The outcomes are better. But, prisoner A knows that prisoner B will probably
think the same way. They will both wind up serving two years. Of course, if they
could only trust each other, they would only serve six months.
In 1980, political scientist Robert Axelrod performed an experiment he called
the iterated prisoner's dilemma. Essentially, participants played the prisoner's
dilemma over and over again, sometimes with the same partners and sometimes
with different partners. Players were allowed to use information from past
encounters. Some people developed greedy strategies tending toward betrayal,
and some players developed altruistic strategies tending toward trust. Over long
periods of time, the altruistic players faired better than the greedy players. The
nice guys finished first.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Two countries in an arms race are often thought to be playing out prisoner's
dilemma. They can both spend a lot of time and money increasing their arsenal
in order to keep pace with each other, or they can agree to disarm. But how can
they know for certain that the other country isn't still bulking up in secret?
2. Males in the animal kingdom often exhibit behavior that fits the pattern ofthe
prisoner's dilemma. Do you just strutyour stuff, back down, or engage in the
cockfight? The best strategies in the animal kingdom seem to encompass a
little ofeach approach.
FRIDAY, DAY 5
Aaron Copland
It's a testament to the low status of American classical music among Europeans
that its premiere composer for almost forty years was not taken seriously by
anyone but Americans. Born in New York City, Aaron Copland (1900-1990)
traveled to Paris to study when he was twenty-one. He studied keyboard
harmony and composition with the brilliant Nadia Boulanger, and four years
later he returned to New York to see the premier of his Symphony for Organ and
Orchestra (1925) at Carnegie Hall.
After his debut, Copland immediately started composing pieces heavily
influenced by American jazz-the Piano Concerto of 1926 and the Piano
Variations of 1930-a style that was just entering the mainstream, but still
considered a bit dangerous. Copland also studied the works of Igor Stravinsky,
but assimilated the Russian's neoclassical tendencies rather than his more
revolutionary ideas.
Later in his career, Copland turned to the music of traditional America,
including the bluegrass and Appalachian music being played by string bands. He
combined these styles with the prevailing pop sensibilities of the day, as
embodied by Tin Pan Alley and Broadway, and stories drawn from American
folklore, to produce several charming ballets, including Billy the Kid (1938) and
Rodeo (1942). His 1954 opera The Tender Land is a beautifully and colorfully
orchestrated treatment of American folk music, and his Appalachian Spring is
one of the most durable pieces of American classical music ever produced.
Later in Copland's life, he was drawn to twelve-tone serialism, but very few of
his works became popular, save for Connotations, which was commissioned for
the opening of Lincoln Center in 1962. He remained active as a composer,
teacher, and conductor through the 1980s until he died in late 1990 in
Westchester County, New York.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. While composing The Tender Land, Copland was subpoenaed to appear
before the House Subcommittee for Investigation and forced to testify as one of
the hundreds of artists labeled purveyors of communist propaganda by Senator
Joseph McCarthy.
2. Copland was also a composer of movie scores, including Of Mice and Men
(1938), Our Town (1940), and The Heiress (1948).
3. The `Hoe Down"from Copland's ballet Rodeo will forever be memorialized in
the Beef It's what's for dinner" commercials ofthe early 1990s.
SATURDAY, DAY 6
Philosophy of Language
The philosophy of language tries to understand how language-sounds uttered by
speakers and written marks on a page-can be used to make meaningful
statements about the world. It has much in common with the field of linguistics.
In contemporary philosophy, the most important problem in the philosophy of
language has been the problem of reference: How do names identify objects in
the world and thereby have meaning?
Consider the following two sentences:
(1) "Superman is Superman."
(2) "Clark Kent is Superman."
If the meaning of a name is merely the thing it refers to, then both sentences
mean the same thing. However, we can believe the first sentence is true and not
the second. Therefore, the meaning of the name Superman is not merely the
thing it refers to (Superman). According to this argument, the meaning or
"semantic content" of a name has two parts: a referent, the thing it refers to, and
a sense, a description of the object. Therefore, the sense of "Superman" might be
"superhero who can leap tall buildings" while the sense of "Clark Kent" might be
"lowest-paid reporter at the Daily Planet." In this example, the meanings of the
names "Clark Kent" and "Superman" are different because they have different
senses. Therefore, the second sentence doesn't necessarily strike us as true.
Some philosophers disagree with this analysis. They argue that the meaning of a
name cannot carry a description. For instance, consider the sentence: "It is
possible that Clark Kent is not the lowest-paid reporter at the Daily Planet." That
sentence is true, because, after all, Clark/ Superman might have chosen a
different job when he moved to Metropolis. However, according to our first
theory, the meaning of the name "Clark Kent" is the description: "lowest-paid
reporter at the Daily Planet." So, we've just said: "It is possible that the lowest-
paid reporter at the Daily Planet is not the lowest-paid reporter at the Daily
Planet." This is obviously absurd and is why the debate over the meaning of
names continues.
ADDITIONAL FACT
1. The distinction between sense and reference was first made by Gottlob Frege
(1848-1925), a German mathematician whose work on language and logic is
highly influential in contemporary philosophy.
SUNDAY, DAY 7
Confucianism
K'ung Fu Tzu, better known as Confucius, lived from 551 to 479 BC. His
philosophy is such an integral part of some East Asian cultures that it is seen as a
way of life, and not a deity-based religion.
Although Confucius's legacy is revered today, during his own life, few of his
teachings were respected. He traveled from kingdom to kingdom seeking
employment, usually unsuccessfully.
Confucius believed the tao is the underlying force of the universe. The tao gives
rise to the opposite but complementary forces of yin and yang, which are the
source of the endless changes that the world endures.
Confucius's goal was to create a harmonious society that could withstand this
constant change. He believed that although people were inherently good, those
who were unenlightened, along with disorganized societies, caused evil to exist.
Confucius believed that each person had his or her own place in the world and
that by cultivating individuals, he could improve society. He believed that one
must begin with filial piety. This concept, at its heart, calls for a son to honor his
father and ancestors.
From filial piety, Confucius laid out five relationships, each with a superior and
an inferior partner, which he believed should be the model for all of society. The
first, and most important, relationship was between father and son. This was
followed by ruler-subject, husband-wife, older brother-younger brother, and
friend-friend. If these relationships were properly honored, that is, the
subordinate always respected the superior-Confucius believed society could
reach the harmonious state once achieved by the ancient kings.
Confucius's teachings are largely taken from the Analects of Confucius.
However, much of his original teachings are unknown because the Qin dynasty
(221-207 BC) waged a campaign of suppression against Confucian works. Much
of the Confucianism that exists today is actually neo-Confucianism, which was
influenced by both racist and Buddhist thought.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Confucius's five relationships have historically been incorporated into the
Chinese legal system. If a crime violated the sanctity of one of the
relationships-i.e., a son stole from a fathe punishment was increased.
2. Confucius taught that leaders should be chosen for their intelligence and skill.
This led to the first civil service examination system in the world, implemented
in China in 165 BC.
MONDAY, DAY I
Chairman Mao
Mao Zedong (1893-1976) was the ruler of communist China from 1949 until his
death in 1976. Mao modernized his impoverished country, but at an enormous
cost in human lives. By most estimates, tens of millions of Chinese died of
starvation or were executed during Mao's tumultuous rule. Contemporary
Chinese leaders have repudiated most of Mao's philosophy, but he remains a
venerated figure as the man who united the most populous country on earth and
ended centuries of humiliation at the hands of the West.
The son of a peasant farmer in rural China, Mao embraced communism along
with many other young Chinese intellectuals in the 1920s. At the time, China
was under threat from Imperial Japan but was too divided to resist the invaders.
Mao was a schoolteacher, but he soon devoted all his energies to politics. From
the late 1920s until the outbreak of World War II, the communist Red Army
battled both the Japanese and other Chinese factions. As a guerilla leader in this
period, Mao formulated the radical political philosophy that would become
known as Maosim.
The Red Army finally emerged victorious, and the People's Republic of China
was proclaimed in 1949 with Mao as its leader. Governing presented a new set
of challenges for the communists. The results were often catastrophic. Mao's
bungled 1958 attempt to increase China's industrial production, for instance, lead
to as many as thirty million deaths. In 1966, Mao launched the socalled Cultural
Revolution to root out capitalist and religious influences, which lead to hundreds
of thousands of deaths and destroyed much of China's ancient heritage. Mao
himself, thoughdubbed Chairman Mao, the Great Helmsman-was practically
worshipped by his followers.
In the West, Mao attracted many supporters from the left, and Maoism
influenced several other guerilla movements, but most people were horrified by
the brutality and destruction of his rule. Only after Mao's death did China begin
to discard communist practices. A capitalist country in all but name, China built
on the unity forged by Mao to become a great emerging world superpower.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. During the Cold War, China initially sided with its fellow communists in the
Soviet Union against the United States. However, Mao eventually grew
suspicious of the USSR. Seeking closer ties to the United States, Mao invited
President Richard Nixon to make his famous trip to Beijing in 1972.
2. During the Cultural Revolution, Chinese were forced to read a collection
ofMao's quotations known as the Little Red Book. The book was distributed
worldwide. Although the vast majority of its readers read it unwillingly, the
Little Red Book is one of the most popular books in the world.
3. Mao's corpse, like Vladimir Lenin's, was embalmed and put on public display
after his death. His marble mausoleum on Tiananmen Square in Beijing
continues to draw thousands ofvisitors annually.
TUESDAY, DAY 2
"The Second Coming"
"The Second Coming" (1920) by William Butler Yeats contains some of the
most vivid imagery found in twentieth-century poetry. The work is actually quite
atypical for Yeats, who is best known for his contributions to the Celtic revival
movement-an attempt to preserve the culture of his native Ireland against
English influence. But whereas much of Yeats's writing is heavily influenced by
Gaelic folklore and mythology, "The Second Coming" is imbued with his
fascination with the occult.
Yeats had a rather unique view of history that he believed he received in
revelations from spirits. He conceived of history as a series of 2,000-year cycles
of ascent and decline, which he referred to as gyres. In Yeats's view, the world's
last rising gyre culminated with the birth of Jesus, which meant that the
corresponding declining, or antithetical, gyre was due to reach its bottom
sometime in the twentieth century. Having just lived through the horrors that
World War I visited upon Europe, Yeats believed in 1920 that the Christian gyre
was losing its hold on the world, and the end could not be far off.
"The Second Coming" is filled with images of chaos and evil. It begins with a
dizzying visual of a falcon "turning and turning" in a spiral, unable to hear the
call of its handler. Ominous visions pile up before the reader, culminating with
the appearance of a sphinx-like beast that arises in the desert. In a perverse
reversal of Christian mythology, the beast "slouches towards Bethlehem to be
born." Although Yeats's precise intent is unknown, critics generally see the beast
as representing the totalitarian systems of communism and fascism that arose in
Europe following World War I.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. The titles ofChenuaAchebe'yThings Fall Apart (1958) andjodn Didions
Slouching Towards Bethlehem (1968) were both lifted frown Yeats's poem.
2. Several lines in the poem refer indirectly to Percy Bysshe Shelley's play
Prometheus Unbound (1820), which Yeats admired greatly.
WEDNESDAY, DAY 3
Salvador Dali
Salvador Dali (1904-1989) combined refined, academic technique with wild
flights of surrealist fantasy to produce some of the most provocative and
outrageous art of the twentieth century.
Dali was born in Catalonia, Spain, in 1904. In 1921, he registered at the Real
Academia de Bellas Aries de San Fernando in Madrid, where he met the poet
Garcia Lorca and the filmmaker Luis Bunuel. Within two years, Dali was
expelled from the academy for inciting students to rebellion and claiming that
his teachers were unqualified to judge his works.
In 1929, Dali moved to Paris, where he joined the surrealist movement. Intrigued
by the creative potential of paranoia, he developed what he called the paranoiac
critical method. According to surrealist philosophy, paranoia was characterized
by the ability to comprehend things from multiple perspectives, and it was
therefore a means of destabilizing the world. By inducing it in himself, Dali
believed he could create more powerful art.
A classic work by Dali is The Persistence of Memory (1931), a stark landscape
in which a pocket watch melts over a distorted head. Nearby are two other
melted watches, while a third is covered with crawling ants. The eerie scene
alludes to time's distortion in a dream state.
In 1929, Dali also worked on the Surrealist film Un chien andalou (An
Andalusian Dog), one of two he made with Bunuel. That same year, he met
Gala, who became his wife and muse for more than fifty years. One year later, he
and Bunuel wrote and filmedL'age d'or (The Golden Age).
Over the years, Dali continued to shock and fascinate the public. He was put on
the cover of Time magazine in 1936, and he wrote a never-produced screenplay
for the Marx Brothers in 1937. In the late 1930s, he was repudiated by the
surrealists for his right-wing political views and avid pursuit of commercial
success. In 1940, Dali moved to the United States, where he lived until 1955.
During his American stay Dali was invited by Walt Disney to design a cartoon
for Fantasia. His contribution was made public only in 2003 when a revised
version of the classic was released. Dali also created a dream sequence for
Hitchcock's Spellbound (1945). Always craving attention, he appeared twice as
the mystery guest on the popular 1950s television show, What's My Line?
Dali spent the last years of his life in Spain. In 1984, he was seriously burned in
a mysterious fire. He died five years later, leaving all of his fortune and art to the
Spanish state. Today there are several museums dedicated exclusively to his
works, including one in Saint Petersburg, Florida, and three in Spain.
ADDITIONAL FACT
1. In May 1955, Dall painted a paranoiac-critical version of jan Vermeer's
Lacemaker while sitting in the rhinoceros enclosure at the Vincennes Zoo near
Paris.
THURSDAY, DAY 4
Factorials!
The symbol ! in mathematics is as much fun as it looks. It is a factorial. If you
write n! it is pronounced n factorial. The factorial of a number is the product of
all the whole numbers greater than zero that are less than or equal to the number
itself. For example the factorial of six looks like this:
And twelve factorial looks like this:
Factorials are very important in number theory, probability, and computer
science. In everyday life, they can be used to find out the number of ways a
distinct group of objects can be arranged in a sequence. For example, imagine
you want to figure out how many different ways you could arrange six books on
a shelf. For the first slot, you would have six books to choose from. For the
second slot, you would have five books to choose from. For the third slot, you
would have four books to choose from. For the fourth slot, three books. For the
fifth slot, two books. And for the last slot, one book. To calculate the number of
ways you could arrange the books, you would multiply:
Intriguingly, zero factorial is equal to one.
Why? Imagine for a moment trying to arrange zero objects on a shelf. How
many different ways are there to do it? The answer is one.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Mathematician Christian Kemp introduced the notation n! in 1808.
2. Factorials can also be used to find extremely large prime numbers.
3. There are other types offactorials in mathematics. There are multifactorials,
hyperfactorials, superfactorials, and superduperfactorials.
FRIDAY, DAY 5
Copland's Appalachian Spring
Copland's best-known work comes from what some people refer to as his
"American Pastoral" period-which also includes the ballets Rodeo (1942) and
The Tender Land (1954). Appalachian Spring (1940) started as a ballet written
for the preeminent choreographer of the time, Martha Graham, but it later
emerged as an orchestral suite, the form in which it is most often performed
today.
In 1943, Copland was in Hollywood, working on the score for the movie North
Star (1943), which was based on a story by Lillian Hellman. While there, he
received a commission from the Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge Foundation of the
Library of Congress for a new ballet to be performed by Martha Graham's dance
company. The piece that Copland wrote was originally for a small chamber
group, but he orchestrated it as a suite for a full orchestra later on. It is suffused
with the spirit of American folk music, although the only tune actually used is
the Shaker hymn, "Simple Gifts." In the section based on this tune, Copland
takes a melody that very aptly expresses the plain, earnest nature of the Shaker
lifestyle and uses it as the basis for variation. The result is a clear, accessible
style that audiences and critics alike found wholly American. It quickly became
a classic, to Copland's surprise.
The original story for the ballet is about a pair of newlyweds on the frontier
somewhere near western Pennsylvania. The young couple celebrates their love,
and together they build their house. At the same time, a revivalist and his
congregation shout in exultation, and a pioneer woman follows her dreams to the
promised land. The ballet is fraught with biblical imagery and wholesome
"breadbasket"-type themes.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Copland originally titled the piece "Ballet For Martha,"a nondescript name he
changed only a few weeks before the first performance. The name Appalachian
Spring" comes from a poem by Hart Crane.
2. Graham also collaborated with the other most 'American" composer ofthe
century, George Gershwin.
3. Though the bulk of the ballet was written in California and Mexico, Copland
didn't complete it until he moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, to start a
teaching job atHarvard.
SATURDAY, DAY 6
Bertrand Russell
Bertrand Russell (1872-1970) was a founder of analytic philosophy. Born in
1872 to an aristocratic British family, he was orphaned at ten. Upon the death of
his brother in 1931, he became the third Earl of Russell and is therefore
sometimes referred to as Lord Russell.
Beginning in 1890, Russell was associated with Trinity College, Cambridge, first
as a student, and later as a teacher. He split with the college in 1916 over his
involvement in anti-World War I protests, activities that led to his imprisonment
in 1918 for five months. While at Trinity, Russell did some of his most important
philosophical work and also mentored both Ludwig Wittgenstein and the
American poet T. S. Eliot. Russell's expulsion from Trinity effectively ended his
academic career, and for the next several decades he made a living writing,
which he did prolifically. Some of Russell's most famous and popular works are
Why I Am Not a Christian, Marriage and Morals (a critique of the institution of
marriage), Problems of Philosophy and A History of Western Philosophy.
Russell developed analytic philosophy along with G. E. Moore. Russell was an
important proponent of logicism-the view that all mathematical concepts could
be defined using the vocabulary of logic, and that all mathematical truths could
be derived from these definitions, using the laws of logic. Russell's labors in
logic and mathematics culminated in the book he coauthored with Alfred North
Whitehead, Principa Mathematica.
Russell also made major contributions to metaphysics, philosophical analysis,
the philosophy of language, epistemology, and the philosophy of science. He
was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1950, one of very few philosophers
ever to receive that honor.
Russell was an outspoken critic of the war in Vietnam, and he died in 1970.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. One ofRussell's most lasting contributions in the philosophy oflanguage is his
theory ofde finite descriptions. A definite description is a phrase such as "the
King of France" in sentences such as "The King of France is bald." In his
classic paper, "On Denoting, " Russell showed how to analyze proper names as
definite descriptions.
2. Russell discovered a formal inconsistency in Gottlob Frege's logical system,
known as Russell's paradox. Upon learning of this inconsistency, Frege felt,
incorrectly, that his life's work had been for naught.
SUNDAY, DAY 7
Shinto
Shinto is the indigenous religion of Japan, inextricably imbedded in that
country's culture.
Shinto originated between 300 and 600 AD. It holds that the most important
deity is Amaterasu, usually translated as sun goddess, whose descendents unified
Japan. According to legend, this goddess's parents, Izanagi and Izanami, gave
birth to the islands of Japan. All people are believed to have descended from
Izanagi and Izanami, but the emperor is said to be a descendant of Amaterasu
herself. It is through the sun goddess that the emperor was believed to have
received his power and right to rule.
Aside from the sun goddess, followers of Shinto believe in many other gods,
known as kami, who are said to reside in nature. As a result, nature and its
preservation are of extreme importance to Shinto. In addition, respect for one's
family and participation in various cleanliness rituals are also integral to
practicing the faith.
Four denominations of Shinto have existed in Japan. The first is Shrine Shinto,
the most common type still found today. In this type of Shinto, worshippers
congregate and pray at shrines.
Sect Shinto describes thirteen groups who worship in meeting halls. These
different sects formed during the nineteenth century and incorporate other belief
systems such as mountain worship, which focuses on Mount Fuji, and
Confucianism.
Folk Shinto incorporates many folk beliefs such as divination and shamanistic
healing. It is far less organized than the other traditions.
Lastly, State Shinto, which no longer exists, was the official state religion of
Japan before World War II. This religion demanded complete devotion to the
emperor during the Meiji dynasty and also tried to eliminate Confucian and
Buddhist influences.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Today, most Japanese follow a combination ofZen Buddhism and Shrine
Shinto.
2. State Shinto's emphasis on loyalty to the emperor led to the Japanese suicide
plane attacks, known as kamikaze, during World War H.
MONDAY, DAY I
Brown vs. Board of Education
The pivotal 1954 Supreme Court decision Brown vs. Board of Education ended
racial segregation in American public schools and helped spark the civil rights
movement that established full legal rights for African-Americans. Historians
consider the case, which involved the school system in Topeka, Kansas, and
several other cities, to be among the most important decisions ever handed down
by the court.
Prior to the Brown decision, black Americans in the South and other parts of the
United States were denied full equality with whites. Not only did black children
attend separate schools, but blacks were expected to ride in the back of buses, eat
at different lunch counters, and even use separate bathrooms. This system of
official discrimination was known as Jim Crow. The Supreme Court had upheld
segregation in the 1896 case of Plessy vs. Ferguson. In that decision, the court
ruled that as long as the facilities reserved for blacks weren't tangibly inferior,
then segregation was allowed under the constitution.
The plaintiffs in the Brown case, however, argued that separate was inherently
unequal. The court sided with the black families, unanimously overturning its
own 1896 ruling in Plessy. Chief Justice Earl Warren, who wrote the landmark
opinion, held that "in the field of public education the doctrine of `separate but
equal' has no place."
The decision, which forced public schools across the South to integrate, met with
stiff resistance from many whites. In 1957, President D. Dwight Eisenhower was
forced to send the US Army into Arkansas to protect the first nine black students
who attended the white high school in Little Rock.
However, the decision also galvanized support for the nascent civil rights
movement. After Brown, African-American civil rights leaders such as Rosa
Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. successfully campaigned to overturn remaining
Jim Crow laws in the South. The civil rights movement culminated with the
Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, federal legislation
signed by President Lyndon Johnson that forbade job discrimination against
blacks and outlawed practices that had been used in the South for generations to
prevent blacks from voting.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. The head NAACP lawyer who argued the Brown case was ThurgoodMarshall,
who would go on to become the firstAfrican-American Supreme Court justice
in 1967
2. The case took its name from Oliver Brown, one of the thirteen black parents
who sued the Topeka school system in 1951 because his eight year-old
daughter had been forced to attend a segregated elementary school. That
school, the Monroe School, eventually closed in 1975 and was declared a
National Historic Site in 1992 by President George Bush.
3. President Harry Truman integrated the US military in 1948-against the intense
opposition of many fellow Southern Democrats-in one of the first federal
efforts against segregation.
TUESDAY, DAY 2
Magic Realism
Magic realism has a long tradition in both Western and non-Western literature.
Still, only in the twentieth century has it come to be considered as a discrete
genre. Although the term magic realism is often associated exclusively with
Latin American literature-perhaps because it was first popularized in a literary
context by Cuban novelist Alejo Carpentier-it can be found in works of authors
from other regions as well.
German artist Franz Roh first used the term magic realism in 1925, to describe
an emerging visual art movement that depicted the world realistically but had
surreal or dreamlike qualities at the same time. The term has roughly the same
meaning when used in reference to literature: Literary works of magic realism
depict the world in detailed, authentic fashion but weave supernatural or magical
events and situations seamlessly into these otherwise realistic narratives. An
important characteristic of the genre is the fact that characters do not perceive
these supernatural events as unusual or out of the ordinary; rather, they witness
them dispassionately, without amazement or awe.
The author most responsible for bringing magic realism to worldwide notice is
Colombia novelist Gabriel Garcia Marquez. Works such as One Hundred Years
of Solitude (1967) and Love in the Time of Cholera (1985) exemplify the genre,
mixing vivid, carnal, and often bloody supernatural events into the characters'
everyday lives. Often, these otherworldly events are steeped in elements of local
folklore. Many come in the form of signs from nature, such as a torrential flood
that occurs on the day of a character's funeral.
Other prominent works of Latin American magic realism include Isabel
Allende's The House of the Spirits (1982), Laura Esquivel's Like Water for
Chocolate (1989), and Jorge Amado's The War of the Saints (1988), along with
Jorge Luis Borges's short stories. But many authors outside Latin America have
displayed elements of magic realism in their stories and novels, from Salman
Rushdie's Midnight's Children (1981) to Toni Morrison's Beloved (1987) to
Haruki Murakami's The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle (1995).
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Garcia Marquez said that his most important task as a writer was "destroying
the lines ofdemarcation that separate what seems real from what seems
fantastic."
2. Magic realism is often considered to be a manifestation of postmodernism, the
literary sensibility that emerged from the 1940s onward.
3. Magic realism is not the same as fantasy or science fiction. Works of these
genres take place in alternate realities, worlds, or futures, whereas works
ofmagic realism are set firmly in the real world.
WEDNESDAY, DAY 3
Jackson Pollock
Jackson Pollock (1912-1956) is best known for his "drip" paintings. He
produced them by pouring, splashing, and dripping paint onto huge canvases-a
method he labeled action painting. Claiming that works of art should be
appreciated as independent objects in their own right rather than as
representations of some extraneous subject, Pollock insisted that his paintings
were about nothing; they were painting in its purest, most autonomous form.
Pollock was born in Cody, Wyoming, the fifth and youngest son of Stella May
McClure and LeRoy Pollock. He spent his childhood in California and Arizona,
and he was introduced to modern art while attending Manual Arts High School
in Los Angeles.
In 1929, Pollock moved to New York City, where he enrolled in the Art Students
League and studied with the regionalist painter Thomas Hart Benton. Pollock's
early works show the influence of Albert Pinkham Ryder and the Mexican
muralists Jose Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siqueiros. During the
Depression, Pollock lived in poverty until 1935, when he was employed by the
WPA Federal Art Project. In 1937, Pollock underwent psychiatric treatment for
alcoholism. While in therapy, his drawings were analyzed by therapists, who
introduced their patient to Jungian psychology. Thereafter Pollock became
obsessed with dream symbolism and the unconscious.
In 1945, Pollock married the artist Lee Krasner. The couple moved to East
Hampton, Long Island, where, two years later, Pollock created his first drip
painting, Full Fathom Five. Although seemingly random, drip paintings were
created with great care and deliberation. After laying an uncut canvas on the
floor, Pollock splattered paint on it with sticks, turkey basters, and heavily
loaded brushes. Carefully lifting the canvas, he allowed the paint to flow further,
until he had achieved a balanced composition. When the paint dried, he cut the
canvas and framed it.
In action painting Pollock discovered a method through which he could create
pure painting with no reference to anything outside of itself. In order to clarify
his intention, he began giving the works numbers instead of titles so that viewers
would focus on the paint rather than on the subject. To Pollock, the physical act
of painting was as important as the finished product. In this respect, he was an
important forerunner of artists who engaged in performance art and the
happenings of the 1950s and 1960s.
In 1951, Pollock began drinking heavily once again. As his health and stamina
declined, he struggled to maintain his foothold in the art world. In the summer of
1956, Pollock drove into a tree and was killed instantly.
THURSDAY, DAY 4
The Normal Curve
The normal curve describes the pattern of distribution for certain sets of
statistics. For example, height and intelligence test scores often fit nicely onto a
normal curve. The curve has the shape of a bell, so it is also frequently called the
bell curve.
In a normal curve, the central values-the mean, median, and mode-are all the
same. That means the average score (mean) equals the middle score (median)
and also equals the most common score (mode). For example, in the normal
distribution of height for American women, the average height is 5'5". There are
just as many women who are taller than 5'5" as are shorter than 5'5". And the
most common height for American women is 5'5".
Normal curves include information about variance and standard deviation, which
describe how widely or closely values are dispersed around a central value. For
example, say a group of children is given a test. Some of them fail; others make
Ds, Cs, Its, and As, although the average score is a C. In a second test, the
children mostly make Cs, and the average score is a C. The first test is said to
have high variance, while the second test has low variance.
Standard deviations are a measure of variance. On the normal curve, 68 percent
of the values are within one standard deviation of the mean, 95 percent are
within two standard deviations of the mean, and 99.7 percent are within three
standard deviations. This is known as the empirical rule, and it is often simply
stated 68-95-99.7. In IQ scores, a score of 100 is the central value-mean, median,
and mode. A score of 145 is three standard deviations from the mean, and a
score of 65 is also three standard deviations from the mean. This means that for
every 2,000 people, 3 people would have a score higher than 145 and 3 people
would have a score lower than 65.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. The normal curve was first conceived by Abraham de Moivre in 1733.
2. The normal curve is also often called the Gaussian curve after Carl Friedrich
Gauss. He did not invent it, though he did discover many of its properties. His
face was on the 10 deutschmark bill.
3. Blood pressure in adults is also distributed along the path of the bell curve.
4. The variation oflight intensity from a single source is also distributed
normally.
FRIDAY, DAY 5
The Bridge between Classical and Pop: George Gershwin and Leonard
Bernstein
The two composers responsible for the classical world's embrace of jazz and pop
styles were both lifelong New Yorkers and heroes of the Broadway stage.
Brooklynite George Gershwin (1898-1937) started out as a Tin Pan Alley
songwriter in the style of Irving Berlin, composing and selling comic, jazzy, pop
songs. In 1924, he teamed up with his brother Ira to compose Lady Be Good!
and thus began one of the most fruitful composing teams ever, producing Strike
Up The Band (1927) and the opera Porgy and Bess (1935), among many others.
Gershwin also wrote many notable orchestral works, including the jazzy and
colorful piano tours de force, Rhapsody in Blue (1924) and Piano Concerto in F
(1925). He died young, of brain cancer, in 1937.
Raised on a steady diet of music from his childhood in Lawrence,
Massachusetts, Leonard Bernstein (1918-1990) was a disciple of the famous
conductor Fritz Reiner at the prestigious Curtis Institute of Music in
Philadelphia. After working for various orchestras, Bernstein became director of
the New York Philharmonic in 1958, a post he held for eleven years.
Bernstein was undeniably versatile. Much of his work is intensely passionate,
like the Symphony No. 1 "Jeremiah" (1941), inspired by his own Jewish
heritage, and the solemn Chichester Psalms (1965), a setting of psalm verses in
Hebrew written for the rededication of the war-destroyed Chichester Cathedral
in England. Bernstein also succeeded with pop-inspired works like the score for
On the Waterfront (1954), the Broadway musical On the Town (1944), and his
brilliant adaptation of Voltaire's Candide (1956).
Bernstein's most famous piece is the Broadway musical West Side Story (1957),
an adaptation of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet set in 1950s New York. The
work is highly influenced by the jazz rhythms of the mambo, the rhumba, and
other Latin-American dances that Bernstein heard in the barrios of New York
City.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Bernstein gotajob as assistant director of the New York Philharmonic after
substitute-conducting for Bruno Walter on November 14, 1943. The
performance happened to be broadcast nationally and thus made a lasting
impression.
2. Gershwin never had time to write parts for his most famous work for piano
and orchestra, Rhapsody in Blue. It was orchestrated by composer Ferde Grof2.
3. A fixture on the New York and national music scenes, Bernstein was an
energetic promoter of the young Aaron Copland and the disregarded Gustav
Mahler.
SATURDAY, DAY 6
Ludwig Wittgenstein
Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951) was born in 1889 in Vienna, Austria, to a
wealthy family. On the advice of Gottlob Frege (1848-1925), he went to
Cambridge University, where he studied the foundations of mathematics with
Bertrand Russell (1872-1970). When World War I broke out, Wittgenstein
returned to Austria to serve in the army. In the trenches of the war, and later in a
prisoner of war camp, Wittgenstein wrote his first book, the Tractatus
LogicoPhilosophicus (1921). After the armistice, Wittgenstein returned to
England where he taught philosophy at Cambridge, composing manuscripts that
became his second and final book, Philosophical Investigations (1953), which
was published posthumously.
Wittgenstein's first book, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus ("Logico-
Philosophical Treatise") was a series of numbered propositions. He claimed that
language has a certain logical structure, and this structure mirrors the structure of
the world. Wittgenstein distinguished what a proposition says from what it
shows. Propositions say that the world is a particular way, but they show us, in
their organization, what the world's structure is. Logic is about the structure of
propositions. It does not say anything, but it shows us what the structure of
language and the world is. Wittgenstein concluded that most philosophical
problems spring from the misguided attempt to say what can only be shown. He
argued that philosophers encounter problems when they attempt to say the world
has a certain structure, rather than just making that structure apparent through
logic.
In his later work, Philosophical Investigations, Wittgenstein elaborated on why
he believed philosophy was misguided. He believed philosophical problems
arise from confusion about language. He argued difficulties arise only when we
use words in nonstandard ways or we ignore the variety of ways in which they
can be used. He wrote, "Philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our
intelligence by means of language." Thus, Wittgenstein advocated a therapeutic
conception of philosophy, in which the point is to clarify the meaning of
language.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Wittgenstein concludes the Tractatus with the cryptic remark, "What we
cannot speak about, we mustpass over in silence."
2. Wittgenstein, Martin Heidegger, and Adolf Hitler were all born in 1889.
SUNDAY, DAY 7
Sikhism
Sikhism was founded in fifteenth century India by Guru Nanak, who had a
revelation that there was a single, ever-mindful God, when he was thirty-eight
years old. This deity was named Ek Onkar. Guru Nanak preached that people
should display their love for Ek Onkar in everyday life, rather than through
superstition and ritual.
At the core of the Sikh faith is a deep belief that all people are equal, a rejection
of the prevailing caste system. This was exemplified by their kindness to lepers,
who were believed by most to be sinners reaping divine punishment. The Sikhs,
not believing that God was vindictive, set up an area where lepers could receive
treatment.
Guru Nanak was succeeded by a line of nine additional gurus, each of whom
spread Sikhism through parts of India and Arabia. Despite their importance, the
gurus refused to be worshipped as deities, insisting they were only repeating the
word of God. The last guru, Guru Gobind Singh, died in 1708. He was replaced
by a text, which is now recognized as the Eternal Guru and is the scripture of
Sikhism.
This scripture is called the Guru Granth Sahib. It consists of not only the
teachings of the ten gurus, but also contains hymns from the Muslim and Hindu
faiths. It was written in Sanskrit, Persian, Hindi, and Punjabi. During worship,
the passages of this scripture are usually sung or chanted.
Sikhs believe that time is cyclical and that their souls are caught in a pattern of
birth, death, and rebirth. The cycle is fueled by the self-centeredness of humans-
their ego, anger, greed, attachment, and lust. If humans can rid themselves of this
self-centeredness and achieve enlightenment, they can break the cycle. However,
this enlightenment is believed to be given by the grace of God, and not,
necessarily the result of one's own actions.
Sikhs are forbidden to consume tobacco and alcohol, commit adultery, or cut any
hair on their body. They also must always wear the five symbols of Sikhism: a
turban covering their hair, a comb, a steel bracelet, a short sword, and a type of
knickers (usually as undergarments).
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. There are twenty-one million Sikhs in the world today.
2. The majority ofSikh men have the surname Singh-meaning "lion'-while the
majority ofSikh women have the surname Kaur-meaning princess." This helped
eliminate distinctions between classes, which, in Hindu culture, were evident
from people's last names.
MONDAY, DAY I
Nelson Mandela
"I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black
domination. I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which
all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal
which I hope to live for and to achieve. But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I
am prepared to die."
-Nelson Mandela, on trial for treason in 1964
In 1964, Nelson Mandela (1918-) was convicted of treason against his country,
South Africa. Narrowly escaping the death penalty, the forty-six-year-old lawyer
was instead sentenced to life in prison on an island near Cape Town. Mandela's
crime had been to organize resistance against South Africa's racist laws known
collectively as apartheid. Apartheid, meaning "apartness," denied black South
Africans-three-fourths of the country's population-many political rights, keeping
them legally inferior to the white minority.
Prison was intended to break Mandela's spirit. He was forced to do hard labor in
a quarry, allowed only one visitor every year, and never allowed to turn off the
light in his tiny cell. Because Mandela's political party, the African National
Congress (ANC), had endorsed violence in resisting apartheid, the South African
government considered Mandela a terrorist. The ruling South African whites,
descendents of Dutch and British settlers who had migrated to South Africa
since the seventeenth century, imposed apartheid in order to maintain their grip
on power in the country.
Mandela, however, refused to bend. He continued to lead the ANC from inside
the prison's walls. His steady determination won the respect of even his wardens.
Outside prison, Mandela became a hero to millions of blacks in South Africa and
elsewhere, focusing the world's attention on the injustices of apartheid. In 1990,
under international pressure, South Africa's white-dominated government finally
abolished apartheid and released Mandela from prison. He was awarded the
Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 and elected president of South Africa after the
country's first multiracial elections in 1994.
After Mandela's election, he invited one of his white former jailers from the
island to his birthday party. The old warden told a PBS filmmaker: "I was very
proud that one of my prisoners ... became my leader." One of the world's most
respected statesmen, Mandela retired from the presidency in 1998.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Under apartheid, a system akin to segregation in the southern United States
before the 1960s, race was the determining factor in the everyday lives ofSouth
Africans. Interracial marriage and sex were banned, and everything from
beaches to hospitals were segregated.
2. In protest of apartheid, the International Olympic Committee banned South
Africa from the games in 1964. South African athletes did not compete again
until the Barcelona Olympics in 1992.
TUESDAY, DAY 2
"Ode on a Grecian Urn"
Among the English romantic poets of the early nineteenth century, John Keats
(1795-1821) is an enduring favorite. His most famous poem, "Ode on a Grecian
Urn" (1819), remains an object of fascination for readers and critics alike, who
still dispute the subtle meanings of its key passages. In a way, this ongoing
debate is a fitting fate for the poem, which itself expresses wonder about the
stories frozen in time on a Greek vase.
Throughout "Ode on a Grecian Urn," the poet's words are aimed at the vase
itself. This technique of addressing a concept or inanimate object directly, called
apostrophe, is a staple of Keats's poetry in general and his odes in particular. The
poet is captivated by the vase both as an object of aesthetic beauty and as a
thought-provoking symbol, a sliver of permanence in a world of transience and
change.
In the first of the poem's five stanzas (only the first and last of which are
reproduced above), the poet characterizes the urn as an embodiment of the ages
themselves, calling it an unspoiled "bride of quietness" and a "foster-child of
silence and slow time." He marvels at the images painted on the vase, eager to
know the stories behind them: "What men or gods are these? What maidens
loath? / What mad pursuit? What struggle to escape?" But this mystery and
uncertainty only adds to the images' appeal; as the poet says in the second
stanza, "Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard / Are sweeter." Likewise,
he envies the vase's two lovers, whose images are frozen eternally on the verge
of embrace: "[T]hough thou hast not thy bliss, / For ever wilt thou love, and she
be fair!"
Few lines in poetry have come under as much scrutiny as the final two of "Ode
on a Grecian Urn." It is clear that the vase itself addresses the poet with the
words "Beauty is truth, truth beauty," which are themselves a cipher. But because
of uncertainty about the punctuation in Keats's original written manuscript, it is
unclear whether the last thirteen words of the poem are spoken by the urn or by
the poet himself-a timeless mystery fitting for a poem about timeless mystery.
ADDITIONAL FACT
1. Although many have wondered whether Keats's poem is based on a specific
vase, scholars have generally concluded that it is not.
WEDNESDAY, DAY 3
Pop Art
The term Pop art was first used by British art critic Lawrence Alloway to
describe the work of the Independent Group-an association of artists who were
opposed to the pretentiousness and affectation of the art world. Creating works
modeled upon popular advertisements, comic strips, cheap products, and mass
media, they sought to celebrate and parody consumer culture.
Alloway defined Pop art as popular, transient, expendable, low cost, mass-
produced, and oriented toward youth and big business. These terms characterize
the works of Richard Hamilton, whose work, Just what is it that makes today's
home so different, so appealing? features a muscular man carrying a giant
Tootsie Pop.
The origins of the movement can be traced back to the 1920s, when a group of
artists who referred to themselves as Dada derided the pomposity of high
culture. Their leader, Marcel Duchamp, earned notoriety by painting Mona Lisa
with a moustache and transforming a mass-produced urinal into a sculpture by
inverting it.
Pop art developed independently in the United States, where it was represented
by major American artists, such as Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, and
Larry Rivers. Many Pop artists adopted easily recognizable styles-trademarks
that granted their work a commercial quality. Roy Lichtenstein, for example,
produced paintings that resembled giant comic strips, imitating the field of dots
used in real comics. Claes Oldenburg created huge sculptures of mass-produced
household objects such as clothespins, lipsticks, and typewriter erasers. Duane
Hanson made sculptures so life-like that when placed in museums they could be
mistaken for visitors. Andy Warhol mechanically mass-produced images of
celebrities, such as Marilyn Monroe and Chairman Mao, and Campbell's Soup
cans-thereby reducing human beings to the level of consumer products.
Whereas British Pop artists tended either to mock or glorify popular culture,
their American counterparts were more inclined toward ambiguous images.
Warhol's silk screens of car wrecks and the Kennedy assassination are both
tragic and commercial. The ultimate aim of both groups, however, was to
demonstrate that capitalism had desecrated art by transforming it into just one
more object of consumption.
ADDITIONAL FACT
1. The Pop art movement is sometimes referred to as the new realism "or neo-
Dadaism.
THURSDAY, DAY 4
Nuclear Fission
In nuclear fission, an atom's nucleus-the dense center made of protons and
neutrons-splits into fragments. The fragments have less combined mass than the
original atom. But the mass is not lost. It is converted into energy according to
Einstein's equation E=mc2, which means the energy released is equal to the
"missing" mass times the speed of light squared. Even though only about one-
thousandth of the mass is converted, this translates to incredible amounts of
energy. The amount of energy contained in nuclear fuel is roughly one million
times the amount of energy contained in a similar amount of chemical fuel, such
as gasoline.

times the amount of energy contained in a similar amount of chemical fuel, such
as gasoline.
Fission can happen spontaneously, or it can happen when a free neutron hits the
nucleus of a heavy atom. After the neutron hits the nucleus, it splits into two or
three smaller atoms and two or three more neutrons. These neutrons can then
proceed to bombard other atoms, causing a nuclear chain reaction. It only takes 1
millisecond for fission to take place. This means that if you start with one free
neutron, after ten milliseconds, you can create about 10,000 neutrons and 10,000
reactions. This is called a runaway reaction, and it is the basis for nuclear bombs.
Nuclear power plants control nuclear chain reactions and prevent them from
running away.
Uranium-235 is the most common type of nuclear fuel. It is a rare from of
uranium with 92 protons and 143 neutrons (92 + 143 = 235). Natural uranium is
.72 percent U-235 and 99.27 percent U-238, a more stable form of uranium with
92 proton and 146 neutrons that will not undergo fission. Natural uranium has
too little U-235 in it to be used in power plants. Even if you bombard it with
neutrons, the neutrons have trouble finding the sensitive nuclei of U-235. They
are too scattered. Furthermore, even if you are lucky enough to hit a few
sensitive nuclei that undergo fission, there are too few neutrons released to start
a chain reaction. To be used in a power plant, natural uranium has to be enriched
by very complex means to 2.5-3.5 percent U-235. To be used in a bomb,
uranium is enriched up to 90 percent U-235.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Power from more than 400 nuclear power plants worldwide provides 17
percent of the energy used by humans. The US has more than one hundred
nuclear power plants, and Francegets 75 percent ofits energy from nuclear
power.
2. In nature, uranium is found in uranium oxide. After it has been purified, it has
a rich yellow color. They call it °yellowcake."
3. The two fission bombs the United States dropped over japan in August 1945
were Little Boy and Fat Man.
FRIDAY, DAY 5
Twentieth Century Music
With the advent of the mid-twentieth century came a host of composers whose
works challenged the very essence of Western art music. One main development
was that of electronic music made through the use of tape loops, synthesizers,
and computers.
Parisian Edgard Varese (1883-1965) came to America in 1915, and within his
lifetime he revolutionized modern music. A student of science and math, he is
credited as being the father of electronic music. His early works show a
fascination with percussion but only begin to escape the conventions of
European orchestral music. Later in his career, after years of frustration, Varese
experimented with mixing and creating synthetic sound using labs provided by
the Philips Company. Unfortunately, technological limitations prevented him
from reaching his full potential.
John Cage (1918-1992), a student of Arnold Schoenberg, started as an
experimental atonal composer and later began to blur the lines between music
and conceptual art. He invented instruments such as the prepared piano-a grand
piano with various percussive objects stuck between the strings. He incorporated
Zen and other Eastern philosophies into his music. In the piece Music of
Changes (1951), Cage flipped a coin to determine the types of variations he
would play.
Steve Reich (1936-) is a descendant of Varese in his fascination with percussion
and electronics. His Drumming (1971) elaborates on a simple percussion rhythm
for more than an hour. More recently, he has begun using melody and harmony,
and his Different Trains (1988), for string quartet and tape, won a Grammy for
the best new composition.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Varese's 1931 piece Ionisation was written for thirty-seven percussion
instruments and a blaring siren.
2. Rock band Pink Floyd's 1969 album Ummagamma supposedly contains a
spoken voice saying the words, "Canyon dig it Varese? "a reference to the
composer, whom they idolized.
3. Cage once wrote a piece called '433, " which consisted of his sitting at a piano
playing "silent notes," or rather, not playing anything at all. He explained the
piece saying, "Ifsometh ing is boring after two minutes, try it for four. If still
boring, then eight. Then sixteen. Then thirty-two. Eventually one discovers that
it is not boring at all. "
SATURDAY, DAY 6
Moral Relativism
Different cultures have widely different moral standards and often contrasting
views about what is morally permissible. Does this mean that there are no
objective moral standards?
Moral relativism is the view that there is no objective truth concerning what is
right and what is wrong. All we can do is judge if an action is right or wrong
against one of various standards. The fact that there is a diversity of moral
opinion does not necessarily mean moral relativism is a correct view. For
instance, there may be a diversity of opinion about the world's physical
characteristics, but that doesn't mean all scientific systems are equally valid. The
scientific methods of some cultures may simply be inaccurate.
To defend their position, there are two strategies the moral relativist can pursue.
The first is to argue that moral relativism best explains moral diversity. They
might ask, given that there are different moral standards, what explains why the
person with the correct moral view came to hold the correct beliefs, while the
person with the false beliefs got it wrong?
The second defense of moral relativism is to argue directly that there is no such
thing as an objective moral fact. Objective moral facts require objective moral
properties-"goodness" and "badness." However, being good is not a physical
property, because morally good acts often don't share any physical properties.
Therefore, the moral relativist concludes, there aren't any objective moral
properties, despite what we ordinarily think.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Moral relativism has few defenders among contemporary philosophers.
2. Philosopher Gilbert Harman (1938-) is the most influential contemporary
moral relativist.
SUNDAY, DAY 7
Zoroastrianism
Zoroastrianism is the world's oldest monotheistic religion, founded between the
eighteenth and fifteenth centuries BC. Its founder was Zoroaster, also sometimes
known as Zarathustra, a wealthy man who lived in Persia, or modern-day Iran.
Zoroaster was a priest in the local polytheistic religion when, at the age of thirty,
he had a revelation. He was visited by an angel who told him that there was one
God, Ahura Mazda, who was responsible for good and evil. (Zoroastrianism is
also sometimes known as Mazdaism, named after this deity.) Ahura Mazda was
said to be nine times the size of a man. He was attempting to create a perfect
world and enlisted both angels and humans in this task. He emphasized the
importance of keeping the natural world-its air, water, and land-pure.
After his revelation, Zoroaster began to spread the teachings of Ahura Mazda.
Zoroaster wrote five Gathas, songs and poems now considered to be a central
part of Zoroastrianism's scriptures. The complete scriptures, called the Avesta,
consist of the five Gathas, as well as the Hapatan Haiti, written by Zoroaster's
disciples.
Although Zoroastrianism remains a world religion today, no one followed
Zoroaster for the first ten years after his revelation. The practice has always
attracted only a small following. Because of this, Zoroastrianism has always
stressed tolerance toward other faiths, as well as an emphasis on understanding
different religions.
In addition to being the first monotheistic religion, Zoroastrianism was the first
religion to believe in a heaven, hell, and final judgment, during which Ahura
Mazda determined each person's fate.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
1. Today, the largest population of Zoroastrians, known as Parsees, live in India
and Pakistan and number approximately 60,000. Roughly, 28,000 remain in
Iran with another 37,500 in Europe and North America.
2. Zoroaster's description ofhell is quite frightening. According to legend, there
is d pit within a dark, narrow crevice. There is a horrible smell and such a
feeling of loneliness that three days feels like nine thousand years.
3. Zoroastrians worship in fire temples. This is somewhat misleading as the fire
itself is not worshipped, but it is instead seen as a symbol ofpurity.
